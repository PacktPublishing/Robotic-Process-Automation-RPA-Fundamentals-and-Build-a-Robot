Step 5: Monitoring and Continuous Improvement

1
00:09.080 --> 00:15.950
The period directly after implementing the process is called "hypercare". In this period, which can last

2
00:15.950 --> 00:21.730
anything from a couple of days to many months depending on the automated process transaction volume,

3
00:21.740 --> 00:24.250
criticality, robustness and so on,

4
00:24.350 --> 00:32.010
we closely monitor the functioning of the implemented process to ensure it runs smoothly and that the process

5
00:32.050 --> 00:33.690
output is correct

6
00:33.710 --> 00:41.220
and according to business requirements. After the hypercare period, the process will be included in

7
00:41.220 --> 00:47.750
the portfolio of automated processes and carefully monitored and controlled by dedicated resources.

8
00:48.380 --> 00:56.960
Monitoring processes consist of activities such as checking reports and logs for errors and exceptions,

9
00:56.960 --> 00:58.880
measuring KPIs to ensure

10
00:58.880 --> 01:00.790
business requirements are met.

11
01:01.040 --> 01:07.640
Checking dashboards to ensure everything runs smoothly and making noncritical and minor adjustments

12
01:07.670 --> 01:10.310
when necessary.

13
01:10.310 --> 01:17.390
Also important is to have focus on ongoing improvements of the automated processes through incremental,

14
01:17.420 --> 01:19.420
but also breakthrough, improvements.

15
01:20.450 --> 01:25.130
That's what we consultants often refer to as continuous improvement.

16
01:25.130 --> 01:33.760
This means that process improvements should be identified, evaluated and prioritized in a backlog.

17
01:34.190 --> 01:39.200
Any incremental or breakthrough improvement identified before step 5) should of course also be taking note of.

18
01:39.200 --> 01:42.730
And that's it.

19
01:42.730 --> 01:50.350
A basic five step implementation plan for piloting RPA in your enterprise. To make sure the RPA initiative

20
01:50.350 --> 01:52.650
is handled well in your organization,

21
01:52.660 --> 01:59.110
it's important to build an RPA Center of Excellence or to make someone responsible for the initiative

22
01:59.590 --> 02:02.260
and that's what we'll discuss in the next lesson.
