Create an RPA Center of Excellence (CoE) - Part 1

1
00:05.420 --> 00:11.150
Now we've seen a basic five step RPA implementation plan and to make sure the RPA initiative is handled

2
00:11.150 --> 00:17.120
well in your organization, it's important to make someone responsible for the initiative; especially

3
00:17.120 --> 00:21.590
if you have any ambitions of scaling the RPA initiative within your organization.

4
00:22.400 --> 00:24.310
And this is what we'll discuss in this lesson.

5
00:24.740 --> 00:27.700
How do we build an RPA Center of Excellence?

6
00:27.710 --> 00:35.390
That is, how do we build an internal, self-sustaining and scalable RPA expertise to run and maintain

7
00:35.390 --> 00:36.140
our robots?

8
00:40.390 --> 00:46.350
Well, regardless of its task, a robots essential job is to make the company vision come true.

9
00:47.050 --> 00:53.710
I think of RPA as a long range capability meant to empower organizations to evolve strategically

10
00:53.710 --> 00:57.550
and increase business value. To achieve this goal,

11
00:57.700 --> 01:02.890
you must advise your company and assist them towards developing a Center of Excellence.

12
01:03.910 --> 01:11.290
A Center of Excellence is developed by 1) building the skills and capacity you need, 2) articulating a proper

13
01:11.290 --> 01:14.740
governance model (and especially for larger initiatives

14
01:14.770 --> 01:15.980
this is very important)

15
01:16.540 --> 01:22.090
And then finally, 3) launching the Center of Excellence and scale the RPA initiative.

16
01:24.660 --> 01:30.540
So looking at the first step, how do we build the skills and capacity we need for an RPA Center of Excellence?

17
01:30.540 --> 01:31.170
...

18
01:32.280 --> 01:37.140
Well, at the core of your Center of Excellence lies the Robotic Operating Team.

19
01:37.860 --> 01:43.980
This Team consists of a set of clearly defined roles and responsibilities, and it is charged with implementing

20
01:43.980 --> 01:50.010
and managing the automation as quickly, efficiently and as safely as possible throughout the enterprise.

21
01:51.240 --> 01:56.760
To build the skills and capacity you need, you'll first have to find an RPA Sponsor from the business

22
01:56.760 --> 02:02.700
side, who will establish the technology as an enterprise-wide strategic priority and that will underwrite

23
02:02.700 --> 02:04.000
corporate resources.

24
02:05.320 --> 02:08.610
Next, you want to name an RPA Project Manager.

25
02:09.030 --> 02:13.470
They will evangelize and drive RPA adoption across the organization.

26
02:14.250 --> 02:18.200
The project manager is the guardian of the robotic process automation solution overall.

27
02:18.210 --> 02:24.480
They are responsible with ensuring a healthy automation pipeline, while leading the operational

28
02:24.480 --> 02:26.510
management for the virtual workforce.

29
02:27.660 --> 02:31.020
Then you'll obviously need an RPA Developer.

30
02:31.350 --> 02:38.280
They are in charge of designing, developing, testing the automation workflows and supporting the implementation

31
02:38.280 --> 02:39.660
of the RPA solution.

32
02:41.130 --> 02:47.280
You'll also need an RPA Infrastructure Engineer that is in charge of the infrastructure support for

33
02:47.280 --> 02:49.590
server installations and troubleshooting.

34
02:50.040 --> 02:57.030
And finally, you'll need and RPA Business Analyst. The RPA Business Analyst will be the process

35
02:57.030 --> 03:03.600
subject matter experts located in Business Operations. They will be in charge of creating the process

36
03:03.600 --> 03:10.170
definition document (PDD) and process maps used for automation in cooperation with the RPA Developer,

37
03:10.710 --> 03:15.270
as well as help out on identifying processes for the automation pipeline.

38
03:17.520 --> 03:25.110
So I really recommend these five key robotic roles to be appointed for any company, or especially for

39
03:25.110 --> 03:28.590
a small company that wants to start its RPA initiative.

40
03:29.490 --> 03:35.910
Note that these roles and responsibilities do not need to represent full-time positions. For example,

41
03:36.150 --> 03:37.550
when piloting RPA,

42
03:37.920 --> 03:41.310
this could be done in as little as four to eight weeks.

43
03:41.610 --> 03:44.760
The RPA Sponsor would then need to secure the funding.

44
03:45.270 --> 03:51.660
The RPA Project Manager would run the project spending maybe between 30 to 50% of her time on the

45
03:51.660 --> 03:52.170
project.

46
03:52.890 --> 03:59.580
The RPA Developer would develop, test and implement the project - and spend probably most of his time on

47
03:59.580 --> 04:05.100
the project; while the RPA Infrastructure Engineer would do the necessary server application, setup and

48
04:05.100 --> 04:10.530
installation, as well as helping the developer to gain the necessary user and application accesses;

49
04:10.530 --> 04:13.380
usually not spending too much time on this.

50
04:14.520 --> 04:19.860
The RPA Business Analyst would only be needed to create the process definition document (PDD) and answer process

51
04:19.860 --> 04:21.870
specific questions from the developer.

52
04:22.530 --> 04:29.940
OK. For larger organizations there are several other roles and responsibilities to consider for the

53
04:29.940 --> 04:31.330
Robotic Operating Team.

54
04:32.130 --> 04:35.780
First we have the RPA Solution Architect.

55
04:36.390 --> 04:42.990
They are the ones who define the architecture of the RPA solution and oversee it end-to-end; assisting

56
04:42.990 --> 04:46.230
both in development and in the implementation phases.

57
04:46.830 --> 04:51.930
They select the appropriate set of technological tools and features and ensures the alignment of the

58
04:51.930 --> 04:53.840
solution with enterprise guidelines.

59
04:54.870 --> 04:57.810
Then we have the RPA Supervisor.

60
04:58.770 --> 05:04.740
The RPA Supervisor will manage, orchestrate and control the virtual workforce as part of the operational

61
05:04.740 --> 05:05.420
environment.

62
05:06.060 --> 05:12.330
Their focus is on continuously improving robotic operational performance and resource allocation by

63
05:12.330 --> 05:18.660
exploiting the advanced reporting and analytical tools that you'll find within the robotic process automation

64
05:18.660 --> 05:20.940
solution that you've chosen for your company.

65
05:22.980 --> 05:28.410
Then we have RPA Service Support acting as the first line of assistance for the RPA solution in

66
05:28.410 --> 05:30.900
deployment in case of any issues.

67
05:32.280 --> 05:39.270
And then we have the RPA Change Manager. An RPA Change Manager is essential for larger companies securing

68
05:39.270 --> 05:41.850
an easy adoption of RPA within the company.

69
05:42.540 --> 05:48.330
They are the ones who create the change and communication plan aligned to the deliverables of the project.

70
05:49.050 --> 05:56.010
They are a catalyst in the transition process, making sure each stakeholder is well-informed and comfortably

71
05:56.010 --> 05:58.280
tuned to the changes taking place.

72
05:59.190 --> 06:05.280
Remember that automation can potentially lead to some people losing their job, and careful change management

73
06:05.280 --> 06:06.990
is therefore very important.

74
06:09.730 --> 06:16.300
So now that we have all the roles and know their responsibilities, we could put them into four categories.

75
06:16.720 --> 06:25.300
The RPA Sponsor is a representative from the Management group. The RPA Project Manager, Supervisor, Developer

76
06:25.300 --> 06:28.960
and Business Analyst are represented from the business side.

77
06:30.070 --> 06:36.520
The RPA Solution Architect, Infrastructure Engineer and Service Support is represented from the

78
06:36.520 --> 06:37.450
IT side.

79
06:37.870 --> 06:42.790
And the RPA Change Manager is a representative from Human Resources.
