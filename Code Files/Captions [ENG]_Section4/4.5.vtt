Step 3: Design, develop and test.

1
00:09.320 --> 00:15.980
All right, so now we have described the process in a "Process Definition Document" and it's time to design,

2
00:15.980 --> 00:18.760
develop and test the process automation.

3
00:20.300 --> 00:26.420
The first step is design. Before development in the chosen RPA software,

4
00:26.450 --> 00:32.010
there is usually a developer meeting where, based on the "Process Definition Document", the process

5
00:32.030 --> 00:33.980
to be automated is discussed.

6
00:34.970 --> 00:40.060
In this meeting, the RPA developer - or developers- choose how to design the process;

7
00:40.670 --> 00:46.790
for example, if we should use a sequence in UiPath or if we should use a flowchart, or maybe we

8
00:46.790 --> 00:51.020
should use another framework such as the "Robotic Enterprise Framework".

9
00:52.340 --> 00:59.600
The developers draft a high level workflow and discuss the logic; they agree on what framework to use,

10
00:59.600 --> 01:06.020
if any, and they make sure that company guidelines and best practices are followed. For example,

11
01:06.020 --> 01:10.250
in regards to naming conventions of variables and arguments.

12
01:12.910 --> 01:20.590
Once the design phase is over, we have the development phase, and that is where we develop and automate the

13
01:20.590 --> 01:28.840
process in a test environment using the chosen RPA software. The development is done according to

14
01:28.840 --> 01:34.600
the "Process Definition Document" and the design, logic and framework chosen in the developer meeting.

15
01:35.650 --> 01:42.040
While developing, the developer will continuously test the process steps and adjust the process if necessary,

16
01:42.040 --> 01:43.570
to ensure robustness.

17
01:45.730 --> 01:47.680
And finally, we have testing.

18
01:49.440 --> 01:57.420
Robot testing is necessary to ensure that potential challenges are identified and mitigated as the majority

19
01:57.420 --> 02:04.620
of exceptions are found and handled during the test phase. Before implementing the process, it's necessary

20
02:04.620 --> 02:09.880
to do proper testing to avoid critical errors once the process is implemented.

21
02:10.650 --> 02:14.340
In this phase, the final robot undergoes different tests,

22
02:14.340 --> 02:23.280
and as a minimum, I recommend to do unit testing; meaning to test each and every component of the

23
02:23.280 --> 02:25.680
automated solution step by step.

24
02:26.370 --> 02:33.870
This is usually done by the RPA developer - or by another RPA developer with less insights into the overall

25
02:33.870 --> 02:43.440
process, so that we get kind of a third party or outsider opinion. Usually in UiPath the automated process consists

26
02:43.440 --> 02:50.470
of multiple individual workflows or projects that are triggered from a main workflow or main project.

27
02:50.910 --> 02:57.000
When performing unit testing each workflow that is part of the main workflow is tested individually.

28
02:58.780 --> 03:05.410
The second test I recommend is functional testing; meaning to test the process to ensure that the business

29
03:05.410 --> 03:12.880
process output is successfully produced. This type of testing focuses only on the output to check if

30
03:12.880 --> 03:16.150
it is per the business requirement or not.

31
03:17.440 --> 03:21.240
And thirdly, I recommend to do acceptance testing.

32
03:21.880 --> 03:27.370
This is to verify whether the end-to-end process flow is as per business requirements or not, and if

33
03:27.370 --> 03:34.300
it is as per the needs of the end users. The test is done by someone else than the RPA developer and

34
03:34.300 --> 03:41.710
it is the last phase of testing after which the software goes into production. End users accept the software

35
03:41.710 --> 03:45.220
only when all the features and functionalities work as expected.

36
03:46.970 --> 03:53.390
If any of the tests identifies that any changes are needed, we need to handle this. Minor bugs are

37
03:53.390 --> 03:59.630
usually handled directly, while major changes would require a loop back to either the development or

38
03:59.630 --> 04:00.730
the design phase.

39
04:01.730 --> 04:07.520
But if all tests are fine, the tested and approved robot or process is ready for production!
