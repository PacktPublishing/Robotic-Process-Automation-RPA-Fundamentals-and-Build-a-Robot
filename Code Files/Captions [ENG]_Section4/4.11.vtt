Real-World Applications of RPA.

1
00:06.580 --> 00:12.340
The best way to get a proper understanding of RPAs potential is probably to have a look at real-

2
00:12.340 --> 00:14.860
world applications of the technology.

3
00:15.790 --> 00:21.930
In the following slides, we'll take a look at three real world applications of RPA from my own experience.

4
00:22.270 --> 00:28.780
Then I will share a link to a very informative blog post with you, where you can find 67 more

5
00:28.810 --> 00:32.140
RPA use cases and applications to have a look at.

6
00:34.090 --> 00:41.890
We will start with the Finnish company "Fingrid". Fingrid is a Finnish national electricity transmission

7
00:41.890 --> 00:50.050
grid operator and Fingrid's human resources department had monthly peak periods where HR resources had to

8
00:50.050 --> 00:53.680
check if time reporting of all Fingrid personnel was correct.

9
00:54.580 --> 01:00.040
Checking the recorded hours was a tedious task and was creating pain for the HR resources.

10
01:01.680 --> 01:09.810
The solution was an RPA called Tero, or "Tero the hero", as they like to call him, and that is an

11
01:09.810 --> 01:13.190
RPA that does two types of work in the payroll process.

12
01:13.710 --> 01:20.280
First, Tero is checking holidays in the working time monitoring system, and then Tero is checking

13
01:20.280 --> 01:22.730
the correctness of overtime entries.

14
01:23.250 --> 01:29.070
So this means that Tero has been taught the rules for overtime work contained in the working our legislation

15
01:29.070 --> 01:29.970
in Finland.

16
01:32.530 --> 01:38.150
The next example is a large international bank with a branch in Norway.

17
01:39.220 --> 01:46.140
So the bank needed to reduce the workload coming from a large number of mortgage loan applications.

18
01:46.510 --> 01:52.210
In particular, they wanted to avoid spending employees time on applications that were to be declined

19
01:52.480 --> 01:55.030
and wanted these to be scored as "red".

20
01:56.020 --> 02:02.200
Other applications should be scored as "green" or "yellow", depending on their urgency. The process of

21
02:02.200 --> 02:09.070
deciding what applications to be scored as red, yellow or green, were completely rule-based. Then

22
02:09.070 --> 02:10.600
what is more perfect than to apply RPA?

23
02:10.600 --> 02:14.060
I don't know, but that is what they did.

24
02:14.920 --> 02:21.490
The solution was an RPA solution that was developed to do all the data entry and to integrate data

25
02:21.490 --> 02:27.520
from a number of different computer applications into a scoring model, thus scoring the application

26
02:27.520 --> 02:35.560
to red for decline; yellow or green. Communication with the applicants and back office personell on email

27
02:35.560 --> 02:40.630
and via various digital channels and applications are part of the automated process.

28
02:43.210 --> 02:51.220
The third example is for a large Norwegian insurance company. Insurance claim handlers spend

29
02:51.220 --> 02:54.910
an awful lot of time preparing insurance claims for handling.

30
02:55.420 --> 03:01.750
This includes assisting policyholders and clients with claim filing; like requesting personal information,

31
03:01.960 --> 03:07.900
recalling policy information from databases, verifying that the client does not have overdue payments

32
03:07.900 --> 03:10.100
and preparing proper documentation.

33
03:10.660 --> 03:16.870
It also includes entering claim documentation and data into various systems and calculating claim values.

34
03:17.380 --> 03:21.950
All this is done before they can even start accepting or rejecting a claim.

35
03:23.110 --> 03:28.330
So the solution here was also an RPA solution that was developed to prepare the claim, including

36
03:28.330 --> 03:34.870
collecting data, entering claim data into systems, do necessary claim calculations, and notifying

37
03:34.870 --> 03:40.360
the claim handler that the insurance claim was ready for their expert opinion on whether the claim should

38
03:40.360 --> 03:42.130
be accepted or rejected.

39
03:43.240 --> 03:49.570
For the company in question, the RPA is preparing tens of thousands of claims each year, and it

40
03:49.570 --> 03:55.810
saves a lot of time that before the implementation was spent by humans on work that required very

41
03:55.810 --> 03:56.620
little thinking.

42
03:57.930 --> 04:04.110
All right, so if you want to have a look at more examples, I could really recommend you to go to

43
04:04.120 --> 04:06.420
AI Multiples blog on this link.

44
04:07.480 --> 04:14.160
The blog post contains 67 RPA use cases and are probably the most complete list of RPA application

45
04:14.160 --> 04:14.580
areas

46
04:14.580 --> 04:19.630
you could find. And the use cases are categorized into five buckets:

47
04:20.370 --> 04:24.150
So first, we have "Common business processes and activities".

48
04:24.810 --> 04:30.590
Then we have "Activities in commercial functions" such as sales and customer relationship management.

49
04:31.560 --> 04:33.990
Then we have "Activities in support functions".

50
04:34.350 --> 04:41.700
So that includes tech support, technology, finance, human resources, operations, and procurement.

51
04:43.230 --> 04:46.380
And then we have "Industry specific activities".

52
04:46.380 --> 04:53.750
So we have used cases for banking, insurance, telecom, retail, manufacturing, health care and governments.

53
04:54.420 --> 05:01.160
And the last category is "RPA applications for personal use", such as digital assistants.

54
05:01.680 --> 05:02.970
Check it out.

55
05:05.800 --> 05:06.790
Section summary.

56
05:09.970 --> 05:16.870
In this section of the course, we have covered a basic implementation plan for piloting RPA, we've

57
05:16.870 --> 05:22.720
had a look at how to create an RPA Center of Excellence and what roles and responsibilities are needed.

58
05:23.020 --> 05:28.900
And we had a to look at some critical success factors for succeeding with an RPA initiative, before

59
05:28.900 --> 05:33.490
we saw some real-world applications of RPA in different businesses.

60
05:34.660 --> 05:36.240
In the next section of the course,

61
05:36.250 --> 05:40.660
I will tell you how you can take what you've learned further; whether you want to start your career

62
05:40.660 --> 05:44.620
as an RPA developer or as an RPA project manager.
