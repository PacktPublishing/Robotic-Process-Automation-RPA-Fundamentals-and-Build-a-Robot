A basic plan for piloting and implementing RPA. There are typically five steps in an RPA implementation project,

1
00:10.970 --> 00:20.420
and these are: 1) Identify, evaluate and prioritize processes that has a potential for automation

2
00:20.720 --> 00:23.530
using robotic process automation technology.

3
00:23.600 --> 00:32.400
And this is also - I would say - the most important step. Once that is done we need to 2) Describe the process

4
00:32.490 --> 00:37.960
or processes that has been prioritized and decided to be automated in step 1).

5
00:38.060 --> 00:43.230
This is done in what we call a "Process Definition Document" (PDD)

6
00:43.730 --> 00:51.710
Then, step number 3) is to cesign, develop and test the process or processes that have been prioritized

7
00:51.800 --> 00:55.400
and described in the Process Definition Document.

8
00:55.400 --> 00:59.900
This is typically done in an IT test environment.

9
01:00.320 --> 01:08.030
Step number 4) is to implement process(es) in the IT production environment, meaning that the process

10
01:08.180 --> 01:16.200
is fully implemented and active and that the process already has replaced the manual process.

11
01:16.550 --> 01:23.010
And then finally we have step number 5) where we monitor and continuously improve the automated process 

12
01:23.010 --> 01:24.450
or processes.

13
01:25.040 --> 01:31.910
What we'll do in the next lessons is to start exploring the steps in more detail.
