00:01.690 --> 00:10.880
Step 1: Identify, evaluate and prioritize processes. First we need to identify processes that has an

1
00:10.930 --> 00:18.250
automation potential, then we need to evaluate those processes in more detail - both their applicability

2
00:18.300 --> 00:25.960
for using the RPA technology, but also their business potential in terms of expected return on investment.

3
00:25.960 --> 00:34.030
Finally, we need to prioritize which processes to automate and in what order before we move on to the next step.

4
00:34.030 --> 00:36.640
...

5
00:36.900 --> 00:44.700
First looking at: How to identify processes. How do we actually do this in practice?

6
00:45.150 --> 00:54.000
Well, first of all it is important to establish interest and understanding of RPA in your organization.

7
00:54.150 --> 00:56.700
This can be done in several ways,

8
00:56.700 --> 01:02.970
for example, you could be holding training seminars and presentations for your colleagues. You could be sending

9
01:03.060 --> 01:06.900
informational emails to your organization.

10
01:06.900 --> 01:12.570
You could be sharing RPA content and articles, or you could have your colleagues finish a course

11
01:12.570 --> 01:16.270
like this one on Udemy.

12
01:16.290 --> 01:24.410
It's all about creating awareness and necessary understanding, so that your colleagues actually understand

13
01:24.450 --> 01:32.350
the technology; what it is, how it works, its benefits and disadvantages.

14
01:32.670 --> 01:38.940
When you've created the necessary awareness it's time to identify the processes that has an automation potential,

15
01:38.940 --> 01:46.920
and a good and proven way of doing this is by organizing internal workshops with different

16
01:46.920 --> 01:54.420
business functions and create a high level long list of processes with an automation potential for every

17
01:54.420 --> 01:56.830
single business function/unit.

18
01:57.570 --> 02:03.930
I would recommend you to have the different business function come up with at least 10 business

19
02:03.930 --> 02:12.090
processes each. And once that is done, you merge these lists together and then you'll have a comprehensive list

20
02:12.300 --> 02:15.800
of processes with an automation potential.

21
02:15.960 --> 02:20.200
So you may ask "what does such a list look like?".

22
02:20.430 --> 02:23.770
Well, it might look something like this:

23
02:25.760 --> 02:32.680
In the long list here we have the "Process name"; indicating what the task is.

24
02:32.900 --> 02:35.170
So here we see the first example.

25
02:35.240 --> 02:39.030
The task name is "Post invoices".

26
02:39.270 --> 02:47.870
Then we have the "Process trigger" which indicates what trigger, event or condition that kick off the task.

27
02:47.870 --> 02:53.900
This could be a schedule, for example, that the task need to be done on a certain day or at a certain time.

28
02:53.900 --> 02:54.760
...

29
02:55.070 --> 03:01.850
It could be a file system trigger, for example, that the task needs to be done whenever one or more files

30
03:01.850 --> 03:09.760
are received, added, modified or deleted in a specific folder on your computer or on a server.

31
03:09.950 --> 03:12.390
Or it could be triggered by an e-mail,

32
03:12.470 --> 03:16.820
for example, whenever you receive an email matching some criteria.

33
03:17.060 --> 03:21.070
This could be that the subject line contains certain words,

34
03:21.080 --> 03:25.660
for example, "robot task".

35
03:25.680 --> 03:32.850
Then we have the process steps which simply describes the process from a high level perspective

36
03:33.180 --> 03:36.470
so that we all have an idea of the process flow.

37
03:36.930 --> 03:44.610
For the "Post invoices"-example we log into an application, where we search for invoices, we do a control

38
03:44.610 --> 03:53.400
of these invoices, before we post them and then we close the application. The next element in the long

39
03:53.400 --> 04:02.190
list is the "Estimated number of hours spent on the process", and it should be a combination of a qualified

40
04:02.190 --> 04:10.830
guess and an estimate - That is what I like to call an "Guesstimate" - on how much time employees

41
04:10.830 --> 04:14.650
spend every year on doing the process manually today.

42
04:14.760 --> 04:21.660
The reason for doing this is so that we have an idea of the time saving potential of the process if

43
04:21.720 --> 04:23.940
automated.

44
04:24.440 --> 04:30.440
Then we have the "Estimated automation potential", which should be your best "guesstimate" on how many percentage

45
04:30.500 --> 04:35.360
of the processes, transactions or task that actually can be automated.

46
04:35.870 --> 04:41.510
As we can see from the example here, the estimated automation potential for the first process is set

47
04:41.510 --> 04:43.220
to 80%.

48
04:43.220 --> 04:49.580
This could mean that 20% of invoices need a humans opinion before being posted, because there are

49
04:49.580 --> 04:52.580
no rule-based way to treat those invoices.

50
04:53.820 --> 05:02.070
And finally we have "All systems the process interacts with" and a general rule is that more systems increases

51
05:02.070 --> 05:08.440
automation complexity and therefore how much time is needed for RPA development and process maintenance.

52
05:10.290 --> 05:16.830
For the "Post invoices"-example we see that there are basically two systems we interact with, which

53
05:16.830 --> 05:21.240
is  the invoice application and Microsoft Outlook.

54
05:21.720 --> 05:25.590
You will find a long list process identification PowerPoint template

55
05:25.590 --> 05:28.230
in this courses downloadable resources.

56
05:33.210 --> 05:38.880
Once a long list of processes has been made, we need to start evaluating the most promising processes

57
05:38.970 --> 05:40.740
in more detail.

58
05:40.860 --> 05:48.360
A good indication of what processes to evaluate in more detail can be found by taking the estimated

59
05:48.360 --> 05:56.850
number of hours spent on the process and multiply by the estimated automation potential. The higher the

60
05:56.850 --> 06:04.560
numbers of hours spent, the higher the automation potential. Then we could for example evaluate the 10 most

61
06:04.560 --> 06:13.200
promising processes according to this estimate in more detail using an automation matrix. And an automation

62
06:13.200 --> 06:16.050
matrix may look something like this:

63
06:18.680 --> 06:25.950
Looking at the matrix we have different fields to be filled with information for automation potential

64
06:26.040 --> 06:29.730
and for automation complexity.

65
06:29.760 --> 06:36.990
In addition we use color coding to identify whether a process has high potential or low complexity;

66
06:37.170 --> 06:44.520
shown by the green color. Medium potential or medium complexity; shown by the yellow color. Or low potential

67
06:44.520 --> 06:47.850
or high complexity; shown by the red color.

68
06:48.240 --> 06:56.250
So if we start by looking at potential we have first the average processing time for a process or transaction,

69
06:57.090 --> 07:01.480
then we have the number of times the process or transaction is executed every week,

70
07:01.680 --> 07:07.050
then what share of the process that can be automated, and then how many full time employees (FTEs) are potentially

71
07:07.050 --> 07:11.460
replaced if the process is automated.

72
07:11.460 --> 07:16.980
Then we'd like to ask whether the process have peak periods because we know that processes with seasonal

73
07:16.980 --> 07:22.430
peaks normally extend delivery time due to little or no test data.

74
07:22.680 --> 07:28.790
And then we ask whether the process is prone to errors, which will normally reduce the automation potential

75
07:28.790 --> 07:29.830
of the process if so.

76
07:29.970 --> 07:38.460
The complexity are shortening and lengthening factors that will help estimate how much delivery time

77
07:38.460 --> 07:43.500
is needed to develop the process using RPA delivery software.

78
07:43.500 --> 07:50.620
In practice companies often set robotics delivery duration to either 4 weeks for non-complex processes,

79
07:51.210 --> 07:57.510
8 weeks for medium complex processes and 12 weeks for high complex processes.

80
07:57.720 --> 08:05.910
Important questions to ask to do this estimate is whether the process input is standardized; because we

81
08:05.910 --> 08:12.300
know that processes requiring a lot of data cleansing will make the robot delivery time longer. Then we

82
08:12.300 --> 08:21.180
ask; is the process input digital and structured? Structured, digital data in limited forms will reduce

83
08:21.180 --> 08:28.860
complexity. While unstructured data, maybe even on paper and in unlimited forms, will make process automation

84
08:28.860 --> 08:32.380
harder - or even impossible.

85
08:32.530 --> 08:34.390
Is the process well documented?

86
08:34.510 --> 08:37.980
Remember that we never automate a bad process!

87
08:38.610 --> 08:47.400
What are the process data sources and which systems does the process use? Fewer systems, use of standard

88
08:47.400 --> 08:55.080
systems that many companies use and systems with good code reduces complexity; while processes traveling

89
08:55.080 --> 09:02.340
across many systems, legacy and proprietary systems and systems using remote access will take more time

90
09:02.340 --> 09:06.320
to develop. Is the process rules-based?

91
09:06.570 --> 09:15.060
Well, short rule-based processes are better than longer processes with a few or no rules. And then we'll

92
09:15.060 --> 09:15.560
like to ask

93
09:15.580 --> 09:23.370
if the process have exceptions, because few exceptions and few errors are much easier to handle than

94
09:23.400 --> 09:26.880
processes with many exceptions and many errors.

95
09:27.300 --> 09:34.920
Lastly, we like to ask if there are any need to make process changes before automation which if the answer

96
09:34.920 --> 09:35.730
is "yes",

97
09:35.820 --> 09:38.880
also will have an impact on the delivery time.

98
09:39.330 --> 09:47.370
Let's continue with our "Post invoices"-example and fill out the different fields of the automation matrix.

99
09:47.370 --> 09:57.720
The average processing time for each invoice is 2 minutes and this is done 1100 times every day for

100
09:57.720 --> 09:59.130
5 days a week.

101
09:59.220 --> 10:04.120
And this sums up to 5500 times a week.

102
10:04.380 --> 10:12.600
We know that 80% of the process can be automated and this translates into 3.7 full time employees (FTEs)

103
10:12.960 --> 10:14.130
a year.

104
10:14.770 --> 10:20.350
The process does not have peak periods and the process is not prone to errors,

105
10:20.400 --> 10:23.370
so the potential here is pretty high

106
10:23.370 --> 10:31.110
I would say. Looking at the complexity, we know that the process input is standardized - It's all coming from an

107
10:31.140 --> 10:39.260
invoice application system, it's digital and structured and the process is very well documented.

108
10:39.470 --> 10:48.050
The data sources of the process are the invoice application system and apart from that, it only uses Outlook.

109
10:48.350 --> 10:59.670
The process is rules-based and it has some few exceptions, which are the 20% that cannot be automated

110
10:59.700 --> 11:08.140
and still need humans to handle. And there are no process changes needed for automation.

111
11:08.150 --> 11:14.100
So now I've shown you some important questions that you can ask when you want to evaluate processes

112
11:14.190 --> 11:22.930
in more detail and I've added an extended process automation matrix Excel template in this courses

113
11:23.140 --> 11:29.360
downloadable resources that you may use in your organization to evaluate processes.

114
11:29.380 --> 11:34.420
You're welcome! Once processes are evaluated,

115
11:34.460 --> 11:40.790
we will have a good understanding of the different processes automation potential and complexity.

116
11:40.790 --> 11:42.910
To find out what processes to automate first,

117
11:42.910 --> 11:49.580
we use an automation impact assessment where processes are assessed for automation potential

118
11:49.670 --> 11:50.950
and complexity.

119
11:51.200 --> 11:57.530
And since we cannot know - with 100% certainty - the exact potential and complexity of a process, such

120
11:57.530 --> 12:05.000
an assessment is a very good and visual way to find the processes with the highest RPA potential.

121
12:05.210 --> 12:11.930
In our example, the "Post invoice"-process looks like a very good candidate having a high automation potential

122
12:11.960 --> 12:13.730
and low complexity.

123
12:14.250 --> 12:20.690
The high automation potential is based on the fact that we can potentially save 3.7 full time employees (FTEs)

124
12:20.750 --> 12:23.840
on automating this one process.

125
12:23.840 --> 12:30.860
The low complexity means it can potentially be automated in approximately four weeks and the return

126
12:30.860 --> 12:38.690
on investment (ROI) for such a process is usually very high - and the payback time very low. Please also do remember

127
12:38.690 --> 12:44.320
that there are other benefits of process automation than just economical.

128
12:44.420 --> 12:47.910
Automation is usually equivalent to higher quality as well.

129
12:48.080 --> 12:54.080
And if high quality is a goal for your organization, this should be emphasized when prioritising different

130
12:54.080 --> 12:54.860
processes.

131
12:58.410 --> 13:04.080
Before we end this lesson, I would just like to add a quick note on where to start looking for automation

132
13:04.080 --> 13:07.470
potential in your organization.

133
13:07.470 --> 13:13.890
The consulting firm EY recently undertook a comprehensive research aimed at providing actionable insights

134
13:13.890 --> 13:20.340
to leaders ready to take advantage of automation and ethically drive business transformation.

135
13:20.340 --> 13:29.640
They mapped automation scores to nearly 2000 occupations in the US, UK, Canada and Australia and categorised

136
13:29.640 --> 13:36.560
those occupations into 15 business functions across 16 industry sectors.

137
13:36.630 --> 13:42.450
This mapping allowed them to understand how applicable automation was to different economies, sectors and

138
13:42.450 --> 13:44.500
business functions.

139
13:45.030 --> 13:52.020
As we can see, the 3 functions with the highest automation potential is: Finance, Administration and

140
13:52.020 --> 13:55.440
Customer Service. In the finance function

141
13:55.440 --> 14:02.910
it is estimated that 80% of tasks hold potential for automation. In the administration,

142
14:02.910 --> 14:07.680
the number is 79% and in customer service 75%.

143
14:07.680 --> 14:15.060
Note that this is potential across more technologies; both RPA, chatbots, machine learning (ML), natural language

144
14:15.060 --> 14:18.270
understanding (NLU) and machine vision was part of the survey.

145
14:18.540 --> 14:24.780
But these functions are probably a good starting point for having workshops and finding processes with an

146
14:24.780 --> 14:30.640
automation potential and start the work with creating a long list of opportunities (in your firm).
