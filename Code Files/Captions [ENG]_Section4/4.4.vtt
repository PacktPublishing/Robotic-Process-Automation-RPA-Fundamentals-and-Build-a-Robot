00:02.260 --> 00:04.900
Step 2: Describe process(es).

1
00:08.100 --> 00:15.540
OK, so once we've found and prioritized our automation super candidates and decided that we want to automate

2
00:15.540 --> 00:23.880
the processes, we need to describe the process in detail. And this is done in what we call a "Process

3
00:23.880 --> 00:25.530
Definition Document" (PDD).

4
00:27.110 --> 00:33.710
The document contains the high level flow of the manual process, and it is usually used as a platform

5
00:34.040 --> 00:40.670
from which the automated solution will be designed. Companies have different views on how a "Process

6
00:40.670 --> 00:45.920
Definition Document" (or a PDD) should look like and what it should contain.

7
00:46.160 --> 00:50.400
But as a minimum, I recommend you to include at least the following:

8
00:51.290 --> 00:56.720
So first we have the process flow description or the AS-IS process description.

9
00:57.590 --> 01:04.050
This could be illustrated using flowcharts, screenshots or other supporting company documentations.

10
01:04.760 --> 01:10.400
This should be done both high level so that it's easy to follow and understand the process; and it should

11
01:10.400 --> 01:12.920
be done at a very detailed level,

12
01:13.190 --> 01:20.030
click-by-click, for the RPA developer to see what is actually done today by the people doing the process

13
01:20.030 --> 01:20.590
manually.

14
01:22.700 --> 01:28.340
Then we have process facts, and these are facts like those used to evaluate the process,

15
01:28.340 --> 01:34.790
so number of transactions a month, the task time, the automation potential, etc..

16
01:36.420 --> 01:43.690
Then we have IT systems, which is used in the process - and a description of what they are used for.

17
01:44.310 --> 01:50.190
So, for example, we could say that we used the ERP system SAP for collecting the data.

18
01:50.580 --> 01:54.540
We use Microsoft Excel for making a report.

19
01:54.960 --> 02:01.800
We use Microsoft Outlook for sending the report on email and we use Microsoft One Drive for uploading

20
02:01.800 --> 02:03.510
the report backup.

21
02:06.610 --> 02:07.940
Process exceptions.

22
02:08.110 --> 02:14.530
So we should have a list of exceptions that may occur during the process and what the robot should do

23
02:14.530 --> 02:20.710
in each of these cases. So exceptions can be both known and unknown.

24
02:21.220 --> 02:27.580
For example, let's say that the email or password the robot uses to log into a web application

25
02:27.820 --> 02:34.180
has expired and an error message pops up. Then the robot can send an email to the process owner.

26
02:34.820 --> 02:40.870
And for any unknown exception, the robot should, for instance, notify the process owner and the RPA

27
02:40.870 --> 02:41.490
developer.

28
02:42.820 --> 02:48.340
It's a very important part of building a well functioning RPA initiative that your enterprise have

29
02:48.340 --> 02:51.370
clear routines and protocols for handling exceptions.

30
02:52.030 --> 02:57.580
In some cases, exceptions can be handled by running the robots again, while other times the process

31
02:57.580 --> 02:58.810
must be run manually.

32
03:00.430 --> 03:04.590
Lastly, we have the business area and department affected.

33
03:05.170 --> 03:11.770
For example, if the solution introduces a new work routine and the Finance Director would need

34
03:11.770 --> 03:17.360
to verify the automated entries, this must be clear from the "Process Definition Document".

35
03:18.130 --> 03:23.740
Also, this section should include some information on how the process will be sponsored and where to

36
03:23.740 --> 03:27.430
allocate the associated cost of automating the business process.

37
03:31.710 --> 03:37.560
Luckily, there are numerous tools you can use to help describe your processes, and that will make

38
03:37.560 --> 03:40.890
creating the "Process Definition Document" a lot faster,

39
03:41.280 --> 03:43.530
and here are some tools you may consider:

40
03:45.000 --> 03:46.530
First, we have Lucidchart.

41
03:47.100 --> 03:52.770
Lucidchart is an online tool that helps you create process flow descriptions and there is no download

42
03:52.770 --> 03:56.380
needed and you will come a long way using the free version.

43
03:57.390 --> 04:03.780
We also have diagrams.net, which is formally known as draw.io, which is another free online

44
04:03.780 --> 04:06.690
software to help you create process flow descriptions.

45
04:07.080 --> 04:15.000
And then we have Microsoft's very own Visio, which is part of Microsoft Office 365 and available to

46
04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
most enterprises using Microsoft software.

47
04:19.800 --> 04:26.700
And then if you've chosen UiPath as your RPA vendor, they also have their very own tool called

48
04:26.700 --> 04:28.920
the UiPath Task Capture.

49
04:29.810 --> 04:36.320
Task Capture comes along as you move through a work process you'd like to automate, taking screenshots

50
04:36.320 --> 04:38.580
and gathering data for each step.

51
04:38.810 --> 04:45.980
Then it pulls everything together into a draft "Process Definition Document", ready for you to fill in

52
04:45.980 --> 04:46.840
the details,

53
04:47.270 --> 04:54.620
and it also creates a UiPath workflow skeleton or diagram, that your RPA developer may open in

54
04:54.620 --> 04:57.350
UiPath to start automating the process.

55
04:59.270 --> 05:05.150
Once you install this software, you can quickly document a process by capturing employee steps in

56
05:05.150 --> 05:11.180
the graphical user interface of the computer. You can create a detailed process description and enhance it

57
05:11.180 --> 05:13.730
with subject matter experts feedback,

58
05:14.120 --> 05:20.060
and then you can output the data as a "Process Definition Document" and a workflow skeleton or diagram

59
05:20.060 --> 05:21.990
to be used in UiPath studio.

60
05:22.550 --> 05:23.900
So it's a very handy tool.

61
05:26.100 --> 05:33.450
I've added an example of a PDD document provided by UiPath in the downloadable resources of this training,

62
05:33.450 --> 05:38.820
so that you can have a look and get an idea of what such a document may look like before creating one

63
05:38.820 --> 05:45.200
for your company. Once the "Process Definition Document" is approved by relevant stakeholders,

64
05:45.480 --> 05:50.640
we go to step three of the basic plan for implementing RPA in your organization.
