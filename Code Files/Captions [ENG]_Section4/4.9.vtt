00:01.700 --> 00:09.320
Create an RPA Center of Excellence (CoE) - Part 2. Once you've built the skills and capacities you need,

1
00:09.330 --> 00:14.490
it's time to articulate and effective governance model and launch the initiative.

2
00:16.170 --> 00:18.950
Creating a good governance process goes a long way.

3
00:18.990 --> 00:22.170
The sooner into automation journey it gets set up, the better.

4
00:23.040 --> 00:29.370
Governance takes responsibility for assessing RPA opportunities and prioritizing automation activities.

5
00:29.740 --> 00:36.140
It provides the guidelines and templates for assessment, design, development and deployment of robots.

6
00:36.540 --> 00:42.840
It involves assigning roles and accountability and ensures good collaboration and communication between

7
00:42.840 --> 00:43.440
units.

8
00:46.280 --> 00:52.940
For larger companies and RPA initiatives, the governance model may look something like this; consisting

9
00:52.940 --> 00:58.740
of larger parts of the organization and including more stakeholders and anchoring in the organization.

10
00:59.150 --> 01:02.780
We often say that "pilots seldom fail, but seldom scale".

11
01:03.380 --> 01:08.780
To have a model like this in place will guaranteed help your organization in achieving its targets and

12
01:08.780 --> 01:10.760
scale any RPA initiative.

13
01:13.460 --> 01:21.710
The model consists of three key areas "Operating Strategy", "Operating Model" and "Operating Enablers" with

14
01:21.710 --> 01:26.660
a total of eight dimensions to consider. For operating strategy,

15
01:26.690 --> 01:31.100
these are "strategy and vision", "organization" and "governance".

16
01:32.510 --> 01:40.100
Strategy and vision is all about defining strategy and vision for automation and clarify how the automation

17
01:40.100 --> 01:46.020
strategy aligns with corporate strategy and how expected benefits will be realized.

18
01:47.120 --> 01:52.850
Organization is all about defining the optimal organizational structure to best support delivery of

19
01:52.850 --> 01:56.960
automation capabilities; both in the short term and in the long term.

20
01:57.770 --> 02:03.560
Governance is all about determining the form of governance, as well as defining decision and committee

21
02:03.560 --> 02:10.220
structure required to empower the automation team and how to provide organization wide support for the

22
02:10.220 --> 02:11.450
RPA initiative.

23
02:12.790 --> 02:19.840
For operating model, the dimensions are "pipeline and benefit model", "delivery model" and "service model".

24
02:20.860 --> 02:27.810
Pipeline and benefit model is all about defining the approach to opportunity assessment and prioritization,

25
02:28.390 --> 02:33.330
for example, like we did in step one "Identify, evaluate and prioritize processes"

26
02:33.340 --> 02:38.230
And it's also about determining the benefit evaluation and realization models.

27
02:40.070 --> 02:45.860
Delivery model is all about agreeing upon the automation delivery model, including process documentation,

28
02:46.040 --> 02:52.460
development standards, templates and policies; which are relevant for step two "Describe processes"

29
02:52.460 --> 02:54.740
and step three "Design, develop and test" processes

30
02:54.740 --> 03:02.630
in our five step plan. Service model is all about agreeing upon the service delivery model

31
03:02.630 --> 03:09.530
to support operational processes, including defining, scheduling, monitoring and reporting procedures.

32
03:10.970 --> 03:18.500
And then we have operating enablers containing the dimensions "people" and "technology". People is all about

33
03:18.500 --> 03:24.920
defining the roles and responsibilities required to deliver upon the operating strategy and model - For

34
03:24.920 --> 03:30.200
which part one of creating an RPA Center of Excellence (CoE) is highly relevant.

35
03:30.890 --> 03:37.880
As well as hiring and training candidates for the Center of Excellence roles. Technology is all about

36
03:37.880 --> 03:44.720
defining the technological requirements needed to support the operating strategy and model; and defining

37
03:44.720 --> 03:49.880
a scalable minimum maintenance technological environment to run the RPA rig.

38
03:52.500 --> 03:58.350
To help you start working on a governance model like this, eight key questions could be asked.

39
03:59.370 --> 04:06.510
So for operating strategy, you could ask "how does process automation align with current digital strategy?"

40
04:07.650 --> 04:13.500
RPA may be a driving force behind digital transformation and need anchoring in the overall business

41
04:13.500 --> 04:17.850
strategy and support from the top management team to succeed.

42
04:19.970 --> 04:25.110
"What is the optimal organization designed to support delivery of automation capabilities?"

43
04:25.970 --> 04:30.470
What should your Center of Excellence look like and what roles and responsibilities will be included?

44
04:32.510 --> 04:35.360
"What does an effective governance structure look like?"

45
04:36.020 --> 04:41.810
How do we balance requirements for controlling governance with the agility needed to succeed with process

46
04:41.810 --> 04:47.020
automation. The governance structure should be designed to work effectively with RPA.

47
04:49.120 --> 04:55.710
For operating model, you could ask, "how are opportunities assessed and the pipeline prioritized?"

48
04:56.380 --> 05:02.110
Again, I would refer to step one "Identify, evaluate and prioritize processes" from the five step implementation

49
05:02.110 --> 05:02.400
plan.

50
05:02.920 --> 05:06.700
"How do we effectively deliver on our automation strategy?"

51
05:07.690 --> 05:10.360
Who is involved when working on automation candidates?

52
05:10.360 --> 05:12.760
What are expected from the different participants?

53
05:13.030 --> 05:18.730
How do we document the work before, under and after the development. An effective delivery model makes

54
05:18.730 --> 05:19.480
this clear!

55
05:20.730 --> 05:24.520
"How do we monitor and continuously improve automated processes?"

56
05:25.500 --> 05:31.080
This is often more resource intensive than expected. A good service model would secure that

57
05:31.080 --> 05:36.810
the development teams can work on automating new processes while effectively monitoring and being able

58
05:36.810 --> 05:43.830
to continuously improve existing processes whenever exceptions and change requests occur.

59
05:43.830 --> 05:48.080
Monitoring and reporting is also a necessity to ensure that benefits are realized.

60
05:48.810 --> 05:55.470
Some tasks to consider for the development team are already mentioned in step five "Monitoring and Continuous

61
05:55.470 --> 05:57.700
Improvement" from the five step implementation plan.

62
05:58.110 --> 06:01.710
And finally, we have some questions for operating enablers.

63
06:03.060 --> 06:09.150
"Which roles and responsibilities are required to operate efficiently and where in the organization are

64
06:09.150 --> 06:11.310
these found?"

65
06:11.310 --> 06:16.080
Lacking competence and experience is one of the largest barriers to implement new technology

66
06:16.080 --> 06:22.650
like RPA. It requires a transformation and a plan for what competencies are needed, what roles are needed

67
06:22.650 --> 06:25.590
and what the different roles should be responsible for.

68
06:27.090 --> 06:28.830
And then we have the final question.

69
06:29.370 --> 06:33.870
"What does a scalable minimum maintenance technological environment look like?"

70
06:34.770 --> 06:39.570
Decisions need to be made regarding choice of RPA vendor and technical infrastructure.

71
06:39.900 --> 06:43.470
For example, do you want a cloud, on-premise or hybrid solution?

72
06:44.280 --> 06:48.810
Make sure to include IT as early as possible in answering this question.

73
06:50.230 --> 06:55.710
And if you manage to answer all these questions and the Center of Excellence has been set up - either

74
06:55.720 --> 07:00.970
as part of a light governance model or a more comprehensive one like the one I just presented - you're

75
07:00.970 --> 07:06.220
ready to push the "GO"-button and launch your RPA initiative.

76
07:10.050 --> 07:15.270
Before we end this session, creating a full-scale robotics Center of Excellence and governance model

77
07:15.270 --> 07:18.300
is not necessarily the first thing you want to do.

78
07:19.110 --> 07:24.510
Going back to the five step plan, as you might remember, the most important step of such a plan is

79
07:24.510 --> 07:30.840
to identify the processes that has the highest potential for automation and start any RPA initiative

80
07:30.840 --> 07:37.020
by automating a couple of high potential processes to show that the technology actually works and is

81
07:37.020 --> 07:38.880
as effective as expected.

82
07:39.690 --> 07:46.140
A proof of concept (PoC) is usually a good starting idea for most organizations that want to grasp the benefits

83
07:46.140 --> 07:47.520
of the technology.
