Critical Success Factors. To succeed with your RPA initiative you should: Establish an RPA Center of Excellence (CoE).

1
00:13.230 --> 00:20.400
The most successful implementations occur in organizations that establish dedicated teams, responsible

2
00:20.400 --> 00:26.760
for the overall RPA initiative. Centers of Excellence ensure that best practices are introduced and enforced.

3
00:26.760 --> 00:36.090
Involve IT: Close collaboration between IT and business is essential for success with RPA

4
00:36.090 --> 00:38.370
in any organization.

5
00:38.460 --> 00:45.860
Business must involve IT from the beginning to secure the necessary resource allocation.

6
00:45.930 --> 00:52.920
Remember to focus on project governance: Establishing an effective governance model is necessary to implement

7
00:52.920 --> 00:59.340
RPA, to handle organizational changes, update and manage processes as well as control communication

8
00:59.340 --> 01:01.010
with stakeholders.

9
01:01.530 --> 01:04.140
This could be done as part of the establishing of

10
01:04.130 --> 01:08.960
an RPA Center og Excellence as we learned in the previous lesson.

11
01:09.270 --> 01:12.010
Also remember to manage expectations:

12
01:12.360 --> 01:18.010
Get to know the technology and opportunities that RPA represents for your organization.

13
01:18.090 --> 01:26.760
Scaling an RPA initiative is significantly more challenging than automating a single process.

14
01:26.760 --> 01:28.980
Understand the value proposition:

15
01:28.980 --> 01:34.680
Prioritize processes suitable for automation that realizes the most value.

16
01:34.680 --> 01:39.250
Remember that not all processes are suitable for automation.

17
01:39.690 --> 01:46.740
Secure some quick wins that can be shared as success stories with the rest of the organization.

18
01:46.740 --> 01:48.450
Choose the right vendor:

19
01:48.450 --> 01:54.810
Select the vendor that meets your organizations requirements to functionality and that aligns with your automation strategy.
