Step 4: Implement process(es).

1
00:07.220 --> 00:12.320
Once the processes have been through testing, the robot is ready for production.

2
00:13.280 --> 00:19.250
We then publish the automation project, meaning that the workflow we've developed in our RPA software

3
00:19.520 --> 00:25.370
are archived together with all the other files in the project folder and are ready to be implemented

4
00:25.370 --> 00:30.180
and executed. To execute the automated processes,

5
00:30.200 --> 00:33.520
we have several options. Using UiPath

6
00:33.530 --> 00:40.850
we could either run the robot manually by pushing the execute button in UiPath Studio as we did earlier,

7
00:41.300 --> 00:46.940
or we could run it from the UiPath Assistant or the UiPath Robot desktop application,

8
00:47.360 --> 00:50.620
or we could run it directly from UiPath Orchestrator -

9
00:50.780 --> 00:58.610
if we have Orchestrator available. For most automated processes, it will make sense to schedule them

10
00:58.610 --> 01:06.650
to run at certain events, which is called a "Queue trigger", for example triggered by a file alteration,

11
01:06.650 --> 01:15.290
receiving email or because there is a new entry to a database; or to be run at a certain time or a schedule -

12
01:15.440 --> 01:17.010
called a "Time trigger".

13
01:17.780 --> 01:25.100
Luckily, options for triggers are integrated in most RPA solutions and will be a part of the robot

14
01:25.100 --> 01:27.230
design, develop and test phase.

15
01:29.570 --> 01:36.470
So just to further elaborate a little bit on "Time triggers", let us assume that our robot should execute

16
01:36.470 --> 01:45.260
the automated process every day at 5:00 p.m., with the exceptions of weekends. To set such a schedule,

17
01:45.290 --> 01:47.900
we use what is called "cron expressions".

18
01:48.500 --> 01:55.520
A "cron expression" is a string consisting of six or seven sub-expressions or fields, separated

19
01:55.520 --> 02:01.670
by whitespace that describes individual details of a schedule to execute some routine.

20
02:02.150 --> 02:07.520
And there are a lot of websites where you can make "cron expressions" to your automated processes for

21
02:07.520 --> 02:13.910
free, like cronmaker.com or crontab.guru.

22
02:13.920 --> 02:19.910
The "cron expression" for having our robot executed every day at 5:00 p.m., with the exception of weekends,

23
02:19.910 --> 02:32.070
will look like this.  0 0 17 * * 1-5, where the asterisk represent any value.

24
02:33.050 --> 02:34.480
There you have it!

25
02:34.670 --> 02:40.580
Check out the websites when you need to schedule your robot and good luck implementing your processes.
