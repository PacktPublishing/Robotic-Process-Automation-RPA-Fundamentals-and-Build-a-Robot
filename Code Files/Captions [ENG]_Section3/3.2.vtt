The UiPath Platform. We will start by having a look at a video from UiPath presenting their own platform

1
00:10.170 --> 00:15.420
before going a little more into detail of the most central components of the platform.

2
00:17.570 --> 00:24.380
Robotic process automation is a proven way to enhance the way people work. By automating mundane and

3
00:24.380 --> 00:29.450
repetitive tasks, users are freed up to focus on thought provoking work that requires creativity,

4
00:29.690 --> 00:31.610
critical thinking and human judgment.

5
00:32.210 --> 00:37.880
For a growing number of organizations, the UiPath Enterprise RPA Platform is the right choice for deploying

6
00:37.880 --> 00:38.510
RPA.

7
00:38.600 --> 00:45.230
With the UiPath Enterprise RPA Platform, companies can gain capacity, enhance efficiency and increase process,

8
00:45.230 --> 00:47.080
scalability and flexibility.

9
00:47.620 --> 00:49.190
The UiPath Enterprise RPA Platform

10
00:49.190 --> 00:55.160
consists of three main components: Studio, Robots and Orchestrator.

11
00:55.790 --> 01:01.490
Studio is a highly visual, intuitive automation tool with process recorders and pre-built drag and

12
01:01.490 --> 01:07.610
drop activities that enable people without developer skills to quickly create RPA workflows.

13
01:07.610 --> 01:14.240
Robots are software workers that run the automation's created in Studio. UiPath robots fit every business process.

14
01:14.750 --> 01:15.230
...

15
01:15.230 --> 01:19.010
Attended robots directly assist employees, while unattended robots work autonomously.

16
01:19.760 --> 01:25.640
And finally, Orchestrator is an intelligent console that deploys robots, schedules work and reports

17
01:25.640 --> 01:26.420
on performance.

18
01:26.960 --> 01:33.710
All UiPath Enterprise RPA Platform components work together seamlessly. Rapidly delivering unmatched,

19
01:33.860 --> 01:40.010
innovative, end-to-end solutions that give customers a competitive edge in performance, cost and user experience.

20
01:40.010 --> 01:40.760
...

21
01:43.080 --> 01:51.480
As you learned from the video, The UiPath RPA Platform consists of three main components: Studio, Orchestrator

22
01:51.510 --> 01:52.590
and Robots.

23
01:54.030 --> 02:00.000
UiPath Studio is the developer tool that is used to automate your processes with the minimum use

24
02:00.000 --> 02:00.750
of code.

25
02:01.530 --> 02:10.170
UiPath offers three distinct versions of UiPath Studio, namely StudioX, Studio and Studio Pro.

26
02:11.430 --> 02:19.050
StudioX is for business users with no or very limited coding skills and is for automating straightforward

27
02:19.050 --> 02:20.170
and simple tasks.

28
02:20.580 --> 02:29.040
It is basically a very intuitive no-coding tool. Studio is for RPA developers with basic programming

29
02:29.040 --> 02:29.690
knowledge.

30
02:29.700 --> 02:36.480
And is for automating more complex tasks. This is the version we will be downloading and be using throughout

31
02:36.480 --> 02:44.580
this training. Studio Pro is for specialized developers with advanced programming knowledge and

32
02:44.580 --> 02:51.090
offer, among other, more testing capability and the opportunity to code C# automation projects

33
02:51.090 --> 02:52.950
directly in the software.

34
02:56.900 --> 03:06.170
UiPath Orchestrator is a web application that enables you to orchestrate your UiPath robots in executing

35
03:06.170 --> 03:13.820
repetitive business processes. Orchestrator's main capabilities include: Provisioning, meaning creating

36
03:13.820 --> 03:20.720
and maintaining the connection between robots and the web application. Deployment, meaning assuring

37
03:20.720 --> 03:28.340
the correct delivery of package versions to the assigned robots for execution. Configuration, meaning

38
03:28.340 --> 03:31.790
maintaining and delivering robot environments and processes configuration.

39
03:31.790 --> 03:40.460
Queues, meaning ensuring automatic workload distribution across different robots.

40
03:40.470 --> 03:45.170
Monitoring, meaning keeping track of robot identification data and maintain user permissions.

41
03:45.830 --> 03:53.240
Logging, meaning storing and indexing of log files to a SQL database and/or Elasticsearch, depending

42
03:53.240 --> 04:00.590
on your architecture and configuration; and Interconnectivity, meaning acting as the centralized point

43
04:00.590 --> 04:04.610
of communication for third-party solutions or applications.

44
04:06.440 --> 04:13.160
In this training, we will not use Orchestrator to deploy and pass automated processes onto UiPath Robot.

45
04:13.160 --> 04:13.730
...

46
04:13.850 --> 04:21.140
We will simply run our processes directly from Studio; and that takes me to the last component, which

47
04:21.140 --> 04:22.880
is the UiPath Robots

48
04:24.560 --> 04:33.080
So UiPath Robots carry out processes and there are two main types of robots; attended robots and

49
04:33.110 --> 04:42.320
unattended robots. Attended robots work side-by-side with humans on their desktops and act like personal

50
04:42.320 --> 04:45.350
assistants to help out with daily tasks.

51
04:46.130 --> 04:54.800
Employees access, schedule, and run attended automations in what is called UiPath Assistant, which is a desktop

52
04:54.800 --> 04:56.720
launchpad for automations.

53
04:57.200 --> 05:01.100
In this training, we will be using an attended robot to run our processes.

54
05:02.420 --> 05:08.780
Unattended robots work independently in the background and handle task heavy, long running processes.

55
05:09.440 --> 05:15.620
Unattended robots usually run at scheduled times on a company server or in the cloud with little or

56
05:15.620 --> 05:17.330
no human intervention at all.

57
05:17.810 --> 05:23.660
But if human intervention is needed, unattended robots will check-in with employees for validation

58
05:23.660 --> 05:30.860
or if there's a question or exception via the UiPath Action Center, which is another part of the

59
05:30.860 --> 05:31.800
UiPath platform.

60
05:33.410 --> 05:39.350
So now that you know about the three main components, what we would need to pilot the process using

61
05:39.350 --> 05:47.060
UiPath is only Studio to develop the process and an attended or unattended robot to execute the process.

62
05:47.690 --> 05:53.660
UiPath Orchestrator is only needed for those who seek to scale their robotics initiative, automate

63
05:53.660 --> 06:00.140
a number of processes and are in need of a tool to monitor, schedule and control the automated processes.

64
06:03.010 --> 06:05.950
So what about the costs of the different components?

65
06:06.160 --> 06:12.580
Well, finding pricing for different RPA tools is not straightforward and prices are usually not publicly

66
06:12.580 --> 06:13.190
available.

67
06:13.930 --> 06:20.410
Prices are often set based on your organization's size, your needs, and how well you manage to negotiate

68
06:20.410 --> 06:21.910
the price with the vendor.

69
06:22.630 --> 06:29.590
However, for the main components of UiPath, you should expect prices of approximately 2000-3000€

70
06:29.590 --> 06:32.580
annually per studio license.

71
06:33.550 --> 06:37.270
And what we will do is to use the free Community Edition of Studio

72
06:37.270 --> 06:46.210
in this training. For Orchestrator, you should expect prices around 20.000€ annually. For an unattended

73
06:46.210 --> 06:53.200
robot, about 8000€ per robot annually, and for an attended robot somewhere between 1200-1800€

74
06:53.200 --> 06:55.870
per robot annually.

75
06:57.040 --> 07:03.250
As you can see, Orchestrator is the most expensive. And one of many great features of Orchestrator is

76
07:03.250 --> 07:08.930
the chance to schedule your automated processes and to have them executed from the web application.

77
07:09.760 --> 07:14.610
However, to start processes without Orchestrator, there are several options:

78
07:15.160 --> 07:21.490
This can be done directly from UiPath Studio or the UiPath Assistant, which we will be doing, or it

79
07:21.490 --> 07:28.270
can be done directly from the Windows Command Line or by using restful APIs. For both scheduling and

80
07:28.270 --> 07:29.010
execution,

81
07:29.020 --> 07:34.150
one could also use, for example, Windows Task Scheduler, among other options.

82
07:35.690 --> 07:40.040
And that's what we need to know right now about the UiPath Platform.
