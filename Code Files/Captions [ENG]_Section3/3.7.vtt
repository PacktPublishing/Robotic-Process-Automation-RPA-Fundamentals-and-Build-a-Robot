Build a robot! - part 2

1
00:03.630 --> 00:05.370
OK, so we're finally here

2
00:05.400 --> 00:08.310
where we are going to build a simple robot together.

3
00:09.030 --> 00:19.170
Let's open the UiPath Studio application, go to "start" and open a new "process" project. And let's call

4
00:19.170 --> 00:20.490
it "cryptobot".

5
00:29.150 --> 00:34.970
All right, so we have a blank project and we want to build a robot, but the first thing that we want

6
00:34.970 --> 00:42.460
to do is to check that we have the "Excel package" installed so that Excel activities are available.

7
00:42.980 --> 00:47.100
So I therefore need you to go to the ribbon and to "manage packages".

8
00:47.150 --> 00:50.480
Click here and search for "Excel".

9
00:55.240 --> 01:00.480
If it's not installed, you have to install it, if it should be updated, you can update it.

10
01:00.490 --> 01:03.990
And like me, it's all up to date and ready.

11
01:05.260 --> 01:07.450
So let's go back to our workflow.

12
01:10.970 --> 01:17.000
I will just open the main workflow and to start finding the different activities for our process, we

13
01:17.000 --> 01:19.990
need a sequence where we can put our activities.

14
01:20.510 --> 01:25.510
So if you go to activities, you'll see a sequence here or you can search for it.

15
01:25.520 --> 01:30.620
And when you find it, just double-click it so that it's added to our workflow.

16
01:31.340 --> 01:33.950
And then I guess we all remember what we aim to do.

17
01:33.950 --> 01:39.690
So we're going to open the browser, navigate to coinmarketcap.com, scrape the 20 largest cryptocurrencies

18
01:39.720 --> 01:45.440
data, and then we're going to save this data in a .CSV and an .XLSX file.

19
01:46.370 --> 01:49.850
The first activity we would need is to open a browser.

20
01:49.850 --> 01:52.450
And luckily there is an activity exactly for that.

21
01:53.000 --> 02:01.040
If we go here and search for "open browser", we should find it. And we can just drag-and-drop it into

22
02:01.040 --> 02:02.000
our sequence.

23
02:03.110 --> 02:09.370
And as you already know, the properties for the activity will be available here in the properties panel.

24
02:09.800 --> 02:14.930
And here we need to choose the browser type and we'll set it to "Chrome".

25
02:15.380 --> 02:20.930
And we also see that we want a new Chrome session, and that's set by default,

26
02:20.930 --> 02:22.070
so that's OK too.

27
02:25.040 --> 02:27.170
How do we use the activity?

28
02:27.230 --> 02:31.260
Well, as it states here, we need to insert our URL?

29
02:31.280 --> 02:40.130
So I will just put "coinmarketcap.com" here and now see that there are some validation errors

30
02:40.130 --> 02:40.490
here.

31
02:40.640 --> 02:44.480
And that's because I didn't put the URL in quotation marks.

32
02:48.060 --> 02:54.900
Now it's all good! So let's just test that the robot is able to open the browser now at

33
02:54.900 --> 03:01.010
coinmarketcap.com and we just press the "run file" button here and let's see what happens.

34
03:02.760 --> 03:05.970
And as you can see, there was a browser window opened.

35
03:07.330 --> 03:14.410
And it was open at the correct site. So now we've completed the first step - and actually also the second

36
03:14.410 --> 03:19.480
step. Then, we want to scrape the data from coinmarketcap.com.

37
03:20.110 --> 03:25.090
And as you might remember, we have the data scraping wizard here in the ribbon.

38
03:25.630 --> 03:28.960
So if I click "data scraping", a dialog box will open.

39
03:30.960 --> 03:33.370
We're just going to follow the instructions here.

40
03:33.390 --> 03:39.360
Open your browser application or document and navigate to where you want to extract data from, and

41
03:39.360 --> 03:43.480
we already have the browser open, so that should be easy.

42
03:44.480 --> 03:51.000
Then press next in this dialog and hoover the mouse cursor over a data source field and I'm just going

43
03:51.000 --> 03:57.390
to hoover my mouse over here in the left-uppermost corner of the data table.

44
03:59.560 --> 04:02.950
"You selected a table cell, would you like to extract data from the whole table".

45
04:03.130 --> 04:03.880
Yes.

46
04:04.900 --> 04:08.480
And then we'll get a preview of the data from UiPath.

47
04:09.430 --> 04:13.660
And here we can see that UiPath scraped the 100 first results.

48
04:13.660 --> 04:17.170
But as you know, we only want the 20 largest cryptocurrencies,

49
04:17.170 --> 04:20.950
so we're just going to change this number down here from a 100 to 20.

50
04:20.980 --> 04:23.620
And once we've done that, we just click "finish".

51
04:28.360 --> 04:33.730
Then UiPath ask us if the data is spanning multiple pages and we know it doesn't because we only

52
04:33.730 --> 04:39.130
need the 20 largest, but if it did and we wanted to scrape all the cryptocurrency data on this site,

53
04:39.640 --> 04:45.490
we could push "yes" and we could show UiPath where to click to get the extended list.

54
04:47.170 --> 04:48.790
So I will just go "no".

55
04:49.900 --> 04:52.270
And then we're back in Studio.

56
04:54.570 --> 05:00.540
What we would need to do now is to click the "extract structured data table" activity within the attach browser

57
05:00.540 --> 05:01.240
container.

58
05:02.040 --> 05:08.160
Once I click this, you will see over here at the properties panel that the data table or output is

59
05:08.160 --> 05:10.710
called "ExtractDataTable".

60
05:15.580 --> 05:22.330
If we go down to the control bar and have a look at the variables, we can also see it is here.

61
05:24.100 --> 05:31.930
And what we need to do with this variable is to change the scope from "data scraping" to the whole project,

62
05:31.930 --> 05:37.030
or "sequence", and the reason for doing that is when the scope was set to data scraping,

63
05:37.030 --> 05:43.480
it's only valid for the activities within the window. Once we've now changed the scope to the sequence,

64
05:43.810 --> 05:48.250
that makes it easier for us to save it later in the .CSV and Excel workbook file.

65
05:48.670 --> 05:56.020
So now the data scraping is done and I will just collapse these windows so it all looks a little bit

66
05:56.020 --> 05:56.560
neater.

67
06:01.930 --> 06:08.110
Next, we want to save the file as a .CSV and .XLSX file, there are, of course, activities

68
06:08.110 --> 06:09.050
to do that.

69
06:09.250 --> 06:20.610
So if we just go to our activities search bar again and search for "write csv", we will find our activity.

70
06:21.310 --> 06:21.670
Again

71
06:21.670 --> 06:24.640
I will just drag-and-drop it to our sequence.

72
06:25.480 --> 06:27.640
And then we got a few options here.

73
06:27.880 --> 06:34.660
First we're asked to provide the file path. Here, we will simply type "cryptodata.csv"

74
06:34.670 --> 06:37.690
"cryptodata.csv"

75
06:41.900 --> 06:45.650
And then we're asked, what data table are we going to write to the .CSV file?

76
06:46.250 --> 06:51.590
Well, if we remember the name of our variable, it's the "ExtractDataTable" that we want to save.

77
06:52.920 --> 07:00.150
So we're just going to start typing "Extract", and we'll see our variable pop-up here so we can double-

78
07:00.150 --> 07:06.100
click it or we could click "tab" on our keyboard and then we're done with the activity. By default

79
07:06.100 --> 07:10.580
the file path will be wherever you've saved your automation project.

80
07:10.590 --> 07:13.800
So that's where the cryptodata.csv file will be stored.

81
07:14.700 --> 07:18.000
And now we want to do the same with the Excel workbook file.

82
07:18.570 --> 07:21.180
So we need to go to the activities search bar again.

83
07:21.180 --> 07:24.120
And this time we can write "write range".

84
07:24.690 --> 07:30.510
As you can see, we have two different activities, but we're going to choose the one under > system > file

85
07:30.510 --> 07:31.290
> workbook.

86
07:32.190 --> 07:38.310
So we just drag-and-drop it to our sequence and then the same procedure again.

87
07:38.760 --> 07:45.120
So in the workbook path we write "cryptodata.xlsx".

88
07:48.450 --> 07:52.080
Then we're asked, where do we want to write the data?

89
07:52.110 --> 07:56.430
Well, we want to write it in "Sheet1" and we're going to start it with cell "A1".

90
07:58.490 --> 08:02.750
And again, we just search for our "ExtractDataTable" variable.

91
08:05.140 --> 08:13.180
Now, I just want to show you my project folder located at > documents > UiPath > Cryptobot, and

92
08:14.170 --> 08:18.400
as you can see, there are no files here now.

93
08:18.790 --> 08:23.710
But once we run our robot, our cryptodata files will be stored here in the project folder.

94
08:24.010 --> 08:29.500
OK, so let's try to run the robot and see if it actually manages to scrape the data and save it to

95
08:29.500 --> 08:32.860
the different files and store in the project folder.

96
08:39.020 --> 08:43.790
So it opens a new browser, a new session, and scrapes the data, and now it should be saved.

97
08:43.910 --> 08:50.780
And as you can see, when I open my cryptobot-project folder, there are now two files here.

98
08:51.320 --> 08:57.980
And if I just open the Excel workbook file, let's just have a look if the data is here and yes, it

99
08:57.980 --> 08:58.280
is.

100
08:58.850 --> 09:04.610
So now we managed to do everything we wanted to do; open the browser, get the data and save it to two

101
09:04.610 --> 09:06.000
different file formats.

102
09:06.770 --> 09:08.060
Did you manage to do this?

103
09:08.210 --> 09:11.710
And if you did so, you've actually built your first software robot!

104
09:12.140 --> 09:13.530
That's pretty cool, isn't it?

105
09:13.970 --> 09:15.190
Congratulations!

106
09:15.620 --> 09:20.930
I've added the project file to this courses downloadable resources so that you may have a look at my

107
09:20.930 --> 09:21.590
solution.

108
09:22.070 --> 09:27.230
And if you remember from the last lesson, there were two more activities in the solution we went through

109
09:27.230 --> 09:31.550
in the former lesson. We closed the browser once the data had been scraped,

110
09:31.550 --> 09:37.100
and we also had a message box popping up at the end of the execution just to tell us that the process

111
09:37.100 --> 09:38.120
went successfully.

112
09:38.960 --> 09:43.430
So if you like, you can try to implement those activities into your workflow now.

113
09:43.880 --> 09:49.040
And if you want to further challenge yourself, try to see if you manage to send the two files as an email

114
09:49.040 --> 09:54.170
attachment using UiPath Email Activities and your preferred email client.

115
09:54.920 --> 10:01.550
You may also experiment with cleaning the data table before writing it to the .CSV or the Excel workbook file,

116
10:01.790 --> 10:06.830
for example, by removing empty columns. Section summary:

117
10:07.460 --> 10:13.400
In this section of the course, we got to know the UiPath platform, we have installed and got to know

118
10:13.400 --> 10:16.040
the UiPath Studio developer application,

119
10:16.040 --> 10:22.250
and we've built a simple robot together that extracts data from a website and saves it in different

120
10:22.250 --> 10:23.960
file formats on the computer.

121
10:24.680 --> 10:29.810
And I'm sure that if you look at some of your tasks at your workplace, you see that you often go

122
10:29.810 --> 10:33.320
somewhere, you get some data and you do something about it.

123
10:33.650 --> 10:38.120
Maybe there is a chance a robot can do that for you now and in the future?

124
10:39.200 --> 10:44.200
You now know how to build an actual robot using one of the most widely used RPA platforms.

125
10:44.450 --> 10:45.700
Congratulations!

126
10:45.980 --> 10:49.400
That is a huge step towards fully understanding RPA.

127
10:49.670 --> 10:55.550
And for those of you that are extra interested in learning more about RPA development, please check

128
10:55.550 --> 10:59.360
out the "Further learning" lesson in section five of this course.

129
10:59.720 --> 11:05.060
In the next section of this course, we'll have a look at a basic plan for piloting and implementing

130
11:05.060 --> 11:07.250
RPA in your enterprise.

131
11:07.550 --> 11:08.570
So stay tuned.
