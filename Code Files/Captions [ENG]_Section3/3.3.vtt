Installing UiPath Studio. Let us install UiPath Studio so that we can start building our very first

1
00:09.870 --> 00:16.710
robot together! We do this by downloading and installing UiPath Studio after signing up and creating

2
00:16.710 --> 00:19.110
an account at UiPath.com

3
00:19.800 --> 00:22.740
So let's go through this registration process together.

4
00:24.500 --> 00:31.460
Start by opening the web browser of your choice and navigate to UiPath.com

5
00:32.830 --> 00:39.430
Once the website loads look for the "Try UiPath Free" button. On my screen, you can see it in the middle

6
00:39.430 --> 00:43.440
of the website as well as on the upper right hand corner of the screen.

7
00:44.200 --> 00:49.860
If you don't find these buttons, navigate directly to the sign up page using the following link:

8
00:50.650 --> 00:53.890
cloud.uipath.com/portal_/register

9
00:54.100 --> 00:55.690
cloud.uipath.com/portal_/register

10
00:55.840 --> 00:58.810
cloud.uipath.com/portal_/register

11
01:05.440 --> 01:10.840
On the sign up page, on the right hand side, you can see the different options and alternatives for

12
01:10.840 --> 01:13.330
creating your own UiPath Automation account.

13
01:13.870 --> 01:19.270
On the left hand side, you will find some additional information of what you will get access to by

14
01:19.270 --> 01:20.670
creating your account.

15
01:21.880 --> 01:24.660
Some of you may see the following text:

16
01:24.670 --> 01:28.090
"Try automation cloud for enterprise".

17
01:28.720 --> 01:34.910
And this brings up a very important point to make, particularly at the start of your RPA journey.

18
01:34.990 --> 01:41.620
It is useful to know that UiPath comes both as an Enterprise Edition and a Community Edition.

19
01:42.310 --> 01:48.040
The Community Edition is meant to be used by individual RPA developers, smaller teams and smaller

20
01:48.040 --> 01:51.430
businesses and for training and educational purposes.

21
01:51.760 --> 01:55.200
And it's entirely free of charge and has no expiration date.

22
01:55.870 --> 02:01.620
And for these reasons alone, we will be using the Community Edition of UiPath throughout this course.

23
02:02.620 --> 02:09.310
However, UiPath also comes as an Enterprise Edition, which is naturally meant to be used by a larger

24
02:09.310 --> 02:16.090
organization that has different requirements in terms of licenses, robots, as well as the availability

25
02:16.090 --> 02:23.710
and uptime of the UiPath Orchestrator Service and availability of 24/7 customer and technical support

26
02:23.920 --> 02:25.750
directly from UiPath.

27
02:26.440 --> 02:32.230
So keep this in mind when signing up for your own UiPath account that you are in fact registering for

28
02:32.230 --> 02:34.270
the Community Edition.

29
02:35.110 --> 02:39.880
So once you've confirmed that you are on the correct sign up page - not on the Enterprise but on the

30
02:39.880 --> 02:44.050
Community Edition - you can choose which alternative you want to sign in.

31
02:45.070 --> 02:51.180
You can sign in with your Google account, with your Microsoft account, with your LinkedIn account

32
02:51.190 --> 02:52.270
or with your email.

33
02:52.270 --> 02:54.190
And that is what I'm going to do.

34
02:56.080 --> 03:04.810
So I click sign up with email and I have the following fields to fill out: Organization name, my first

35
03:04.810 --> 03:11.230
name, my last name, country, email and the password that I want to use to log into the account in the

36
03:11.230 --> 03:11.690
future.

37
03:12.400 --> 03:14.890
So let's proceed to complete the sign up process.

38
03:16.870 --> 03:22.360
The first thing we need to do is to enter our organization name, and if you are like me and use your private

39
03:22.360 --> 03:26.260
and personal email and don't have an organization name to enter, don't worry.

40
03:26.260 --> 03:31.420
You can still complete the sign up by, for instance, using your last name as the organization name.

41
03:32.500 --> 03:35.740
Now, if you have an organization name to enter, feel free to do so,

42
03:35.740 --> 03:38.500
but you can continue signing up even if you don't.

43
03:39.730 --> 03:46.080
In my case, my last name is "Flaa", so I enter this as the organization name.

44
03:46.810 --> 03:50.440
My first name is "Tor-Inge" and my last name is again "Flaa".

45
03:51.160 --> 03:56.140
I select my country, which is Norway, and then I fill in my email and the password I want to use to

46
03:56.140 --> 03:58.270
log into my account in the future.

47
04:00.040 --> 04:05.860
You then have to confirm that you agree to the license terms an acceptable use policies, in addition,

48
04:05.860 --> 04:11.340
you have the option to receive information about UiPath products, services, events and promotions by

49
04:11.340 --> 04:11.790
email.

50
04:12.100 --> 04:17.710
And I strongly suggest you do so as there are many, many exciting things to follow from UiPath in

51
04:17.710 --> 04:18.640
the near future.

52
04:20.220 --> 04:24.990
So once all the information has been filled in and the appropriate boxes has been ticked off, you can press

53
04:25.240 --> 04:29.250
sign up. Now before we can download and install 

54
04:29.250 --> 04:30.060
UiPath Studio

55
04:30.100 --> 04:32.160
We need to verify our email.

56
04:32.310 --> 04:37.900
And in order to do that, log into the email account you used to register, find the email from

57
04:37.920 --> 04:42.820
UiPath Platform and verify your email address by pressing the verify email button.

58
04:43.470 --> 04:48.720
This should quickly bring you back to the UiPath website, and as soon as the website is finished

59
04:48.720 --> 04:51.710
loading, you can download UiPath Studio,

60
04:51.720 --> 04:53.730
so press the blue button.

61
04:54.510 --> 04:55.320
This should start

62
04:55.320 --> 05:00.480
your download process and depending on your internet speed, it may take some time, but as soon as

63
05:00.480 --> 05:05.520
the download is complete, you could either click the application directly from the download toolbar

64
05:05.730 --> 05:11.070
or you can open the download folder to find the file on your computer. Proceed to click the

65
05:11.070 --> 05:15.050
file to start the installation process.

66
05:15.180 --> 05:18.240
Again, this may take some time, so give it a few minutes.

67
05:19.440 --> 05:23.640
As soon as the installation is completed, you will be asked to sign in.

68
05:24.510 --> 05:29.850
Now it's important to know that unless you created an account in advance of downloading and installing

69
05:29.850 --> 05:33.740
UiPath Studio, it will be unable to complete this process step.

70
05:34.410 --> 05:39.480
But because we already created an account, pressing sign in will automatically connect your Studio

71
05:39.480 --> 05:41.760
to the UiPath cloud solution.

72
05:42.960 --> 05:48.380
In some cases you might be asked in a dialog box in your web browser to allow UiPath to connect.

73
05:48.390 --> 05:50.100
If that's the case, do so.

74
05:51.600 --> 05:58.800
Some of you may be prompted with a window where you have to choose a profile, and in this window

75
05:58.800 --> 06:06.390
you will have to choose between UiPath Studio, UiPath Studio Pro and UiPath StudioX.

76
06:06.930 --> 06:11.580
And as we know from the previous video, we should choose UiPath Studio.

77
06:12.630 --> 06:13.980
Congratulations!

78
06:13.980 --> 06:19.590
You have successfully installed UiPath Studio and you're now ready to start building and running your

79
06:19.590 --> 06:21.420
own personal robots.
