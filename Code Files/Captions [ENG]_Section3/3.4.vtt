Get to know the UiPath Studio user interface, part 1. Now that we have installed UiPath Studio,

1
00:09.310 --> 00:15.070
let's begin by opening the application for the first time and have a look at the different elements

2
00:15.070 --> 00:17.440
and menu options in the start screen.

3
00:18.520 --> 00:25.270
Start by opening your UiPath application. You can look it up by searching among your other applications,

4
00:25.270 --> 00:29.680
or for example, like me, pin it to your taskbar and run it from there.

5
00:33.820 --> 00:39.940
Once you've opened Studio, you are greeted with the "Start" tab. As you can see, there is a sidebar menu

6
00:39.940 --> 00:41.460
with a few different options.

7
00:41.470 --> 00:45.280
So let's go through these together, starting with the "Start" tab.

8
00:46.920 --> 00:52.980
The "Start" tab is where you can open an already existing project or create a new one, either from scratch

9
00:52.980 --> 01:00.000
or from a predefined template. Let us take a closer look at the different options for starting a new

10
01:00.000 --> 01:00.590
project.

11
01:02.830 --> 01:06.180
When starting a new project, we have three different options.

12
01:06.220 --> 01:13.240
We can start by creating a new blank process, create a reusable component (called a library), or create

13
01:13.240 --> 01:16.540
our own template. By clicking "process"

14
01:16.550 --> 01:22.040
you can create a blank project, which is a clean slate in which you can build your project from scratch.

15
01:22.660 --> 01:28.510
It has no template nor anything predefined in your workspace, which means that you will have to define

16
01:28.510 --> 01:33.890
everything from scratch yourself in order to build your new automation. For the most part,

17
01:33.910 --> 01:38.350
this is what we will be doing when building our robot in the following lessons.

18
01:40.250 --> 01:46.730
We also have the option to create a new "Library". A library is a collection of reusable components,

19
01:47.000 --> 01:53.600
and a reusable component is a workflow that can be used as an activity across multiple projects, which

20
01:53.600 --> 01:58.670
gives us the opportunity to define common code only once and reuse it multiple times.

21
01:59.180 --> 02:05.270
Reuse is a key enabler for improving efficiency, and reuse in code is one of the smartest things you

22
02:05.270 --> 02:07.100
can do as an RPA developer.

23
02:09.140 --> 02:14.570
Lastly, we have the option to create our own "Template". Studio offers us the chance to create our own

24
02:14.570 --> 02:21.590
template that may contain a particular set of dependencies and/or built in workflows with already defined

25
02:21.590 --> 02:26.990
variables and arguments that can be used to speed up the development of future projects.

26
02:27.620 --> 02:30.680
If you don't find that a particular template meet your requirements,

27
02:30.680 --> 02:33.320
building your own might be a great alternative.

28
02:35.160 --> 02:41.520
Below, we have a set of predefined templates from which we can choose to start a new project.

29
02:41.520 --> 02:47.610
Project templates are incredibly useful as they speed up the automation design when used as a starting point

30
02:47.610 --> 02:48.690
for a new project.

31
02:49.350 --> 02:54.850
Depending on your version of Studio, you might be seeing some or all of the following predefined templates:

32
02:55.440 --> 03:01.440
We have "Background Process", "Orchestration Process", "Transactional Process", "Trigger Based Attended Automation",

33
03:01.440 --> 03:05.310
and lastly, "Robotic Enterprise Framework".

34
03:06.980 --> 03:12.260
The "Background Process" is a template for creating processes that can be run in parallel on the same

35
03:12.260 --> 03:18.590
robot as long as they don't contain interacting activities, such as clicking on buttons or typing text.

36
03:19.790 --> 03:25.430
The "Orchestration Process" is a fairly complex template that support service orchestration, human

37
03:25.430 --> 03:29.570
intervention and long running transactions on unattended robots.

38
03:30.140 --> 03:35.810
Now, human intervention is something that comes into play when certain processes require human input

39
03:35.810 --> 03:41.520
to handle exceptions, approvals or validation before proceeding to the next step.

40
03:42.350 --> 03:48.140
Being able to involve humans when needed and suspending the process, freeing up the robot until the

41
03:48.140 --> 03:52.620
human task is complete can lead to incredible useful processes.

42
03:53.000 --> 03:58.970
However, this template is fairly complex and I recommend that you only look at this when you've gained

43
03:58.970 --> 04:02.270
more experience working with the UiPath platform.

44
04:04.070 --> 04:09.620
The "Transactional Process" template is a project based on a flowchart optimized for basic automation

45
04:09.620 --> 04:11.810
processes of a transactional nature.

46
04:12.680 --> 04:17.180
This means a process that repeats itself as long as certain conditions are met.

47
04:18.050 --> 04:23.330
"Trigger Based Attended Automation" template is a project tailored to monitor certain triggers, such

48
04:23.330 --> 04:27.470
as a mouse or keyboard event and start an automation in response to this.

49
04:28.190 --> 04:33.590
Think of it as creating a macro that triggers in response to a click of your mouse or a button on your

50
04:33.590 --> 04:33.930
keyboard.

51
04:34.910 --> 04:38.540
And lastly, we have the "Robotic Enterprise Framework Template".

52
04:38.780 --> 04:44.660
The "Robotic Enterprise Framework" is a project which handles the basic needs of any business process automation,

53
04:44.660 --> 04:48.420
like reading and storing configuration files,

54
04:48.440 --> 04:54.890
retrying transactions that fail, handling exceptions and logging the status of all process transactions -

55
04:54.890 --> 04:56.450
whether they fail or succeed.

56
04:57.560 --> 05:03.680
The "Robotic Enterprise Framework" - or "ReFrameWork", as we call it, is created to fit all the development

57
05:03.680 --> 05:04.730
best practices,

58
05:04.730 --> 05:08.870
and it is a template that I use for almost all of my own automation projects.

59
05:10.390 --> 05:16.450
Now, UiPath offers their own tutorials to use this particular framework, and I encourage you to look

60
05:16.450 --> 05:20.830
into that, but only when you've got more experience working in the UiPath platform.

61
05:23.090 --> 05:26.060
The next item in the sidebar menu is "Templates".

62
05:26.240 --> 05:30.390
This is simply an overview of the different templates available to you in a different view,

63
05:30.410 --> 05:33.170
so let us skip ahead to the next item; "Team".

64
05:34.550 --> 05:41.920
The "Team" tab provides access to different source control depositories such as GIT, TFS and SVN.

65
05:42.680 --> 05:48.510
If this is the first time opening UiPath Studio, you might not be seeing the same options as me.

66
05:48.830 --> 05:53.030
You can enable and disable the different source control options from the "Settings" tab.

67
05:54.860 --> 06:00.650
The "Tools" tab is where you can install different extensions that enable you to automate across different

68
06:00.650 --> 06:07.790
web browsers and applications. You also gain access to a few different applications - or apps - that might

69
06:07.790 --> 06:11.960
become useful as you get more experience working with UiPath.

70
06:13.590 --> 06:20.130
Moving on to the "Settings" tab. This is where you customize UiPath Studio to your specific needs.

71
06:20.580 --> 06:27.200
Now let us only look at the settings that are relevant to us as we are starting out with UiPath.

72
06:27.210 --> 06:28.190
In the "General" tab

73
06:28.200 --> 06:31.890
you can set the interface language and the theme of Studio;

74
06:32.130 --> 06:36.600
and of course UiPath comes with a dark theme for those of you that prefer that.

75
06:39.890 --> 06:46.640
In the "Design" tab, you can change the behavior of Studio such as the frequency of auto backup, the

76
06:46.640 --> 06:52.190
published project time out (which is the time taken before an activity that fails, throws an exception)

77
06:52.550 --> 06:57.230
and whether or not to minimize Studio when running processes and much, much more.

78
06:57.770 --> 07:02.570
You might be revisiting some of these settings when you start working on your own projects to better

79
07:02.570 --> 07:03.800
fit your needs.

80
07:04.910 --> 07:09.740
The "Locations" tab is where you can change the default storage location of your automation projects.

81
07:10.160 --> 07:16.580
By default, all projects will be stored in the UiPath folder located in your documents folder.

82
07:18.390 --> 07:23.430
And lastly, we have the "Teams" tab, which is where you enable the different source control options,

83
07:23.430 --> 07:24.990
as mentioned earlier.

84
07:28.060 --> 07:33.800
Moving on to the last tab, the "Help" tab; this is where you will find useful links, including the project

85
07:33.820 --> 07:41.350
documentation, a link to the Community Forum, a Help Center, UiPath Academy, Release Notes and so on.

86
07:41.350 --> 07:41.620
...

87
07:42.520 --> 07:48.850
And on the right hand side, you will find information about your Studio version and license, your update

88
07:48.850 --> 07:51.250
channel and system information.

89
07:53.240 --> 07:54.110
And that's it!

90
07:54.650 --> 08:01.760
That's what you need to know before opening your first project in UiPath Studio. In the next lesson,

91
08:01.760 --> 08:07.670
we will create a blank project and have a look at the interface where we will build and automate processes.
