If you have noticed yourself, or your team, working on activities that require little or no thinking -

1
00:13.040 --> 00:19.130
or working on activities that require you to jump from application to application: Robotic Process Automation

2
00:19.130 --> 00:21.110
may be exactly what you need.

3
00:22.110 --> 00:28.400
Robotic Process Automation is the use of software to handle high volume, repeatable tasks that previously

4
00:28.400 --> 00:30.070
required us humans to perform.

5
00:30.830 --> 00:34.920
And much like physical robots have automated blue collar work in factories,

6
00:35.240 --> 00:39.630
RPA software is coming for white collar work with an enormous speed.

7
00:40.460 --> 00:47.510
Hi, my name is Tor, and I am an experienced RPA project manager and RPA developer and I've helped

8
00:47.510 --> 00:50.540
several companies pilot and scale their Robotic Process Automation

9
00:50.540 --> 00:56.630
initiatives across their organizations. In this course we will start with getting to know what

10
00:56.630 --> 00:58.730
RPA is, how it works,

11
00:58.910 --> 00:59.780
why now?,

12
00:59.960 --> 01:05.840
the pros and cons of the technology and what vendors are out there. Then we will build a simple

13
01:05.840 --> 01:10.570
robot together using one of the most popular RPA softwares - UiPath.

14
01:10.970 --> 01:16.420
Before we wrap it all up by looking at a five step implementation plan on how you can implement

15
01:16.430 --> 01:18.260
RPA in your organization.

16
01:19.400 --> 01:26.330
This course is perfect for anyone who want to confidently discuss and explain RPA in an enterprise setting

17
01:26.330 --> 01:27.930
or at a job interview.

18
01:28.490 --> 01:33.710
It's perfect for those of you that want to start a career as an RPA professional; as you'll understand

19
01:33.710 --> 01:39.710
both the big picture and how the technology works in practice - and it is perfect for those of you that want

20
01:39.710 --> 01:41.210
to build your first software robot.

21
01:41.450 --> 01:44.190
I'm really looking forward to having you as my student;

22
01:44.210 --> 01:46.400
so what are we waiting for?

23
01:46.730 --> 01:47.940
Let's get started!:)
