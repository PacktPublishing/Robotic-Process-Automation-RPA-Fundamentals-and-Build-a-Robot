[Course summary]. And that brings us to the end of this course.

1
00:07.450 --> 00:10.220
So - what have we actually covered in this course?

2
00:10.270 --> 00:17.560
Well, first we covered what RPA is and how it works, why it's interesting right now, what benefits

3
00:17.560 --> 00:23.500
and disadvantages the technology has, what vendors there are and we had a look at a real world example

4
00:23.560 --> 00:29.790
of how RPA has been applied to generate value for a Norwegian real estate company.

5
00:29.970 --> 00:37.420
Then we had a look at the UiPath platform consisting of UiPath Studio, UiPath Robot, UiPath Orchestrator

6
00:37.510 --> 00:44.110
and we got to know the UiPath Studio even better, where we built a simple software robot together.

7
00:44.110 --> 00:45.750
...

8
00:45.760 --> 00:52.870
Finally, we envisioned a basic plan for how to implement RPA in an enterprise setting, as well as

9
00:52.870 --> 00:58.900
having a look at what roles and responsibilities are needed for an RPA Center of Excellence,

10
00:59.050 --> 01:04.860
and what the important success factors are for succeeding with an RPA initiative.

11
01:04.870 --> 01:09.420
And finally - in this section - we discussed what the next steps are

12
01:09.520 --> 01:15.040
if you want to further improve your skills and pursue a career either as an RPA project manager or an

13
01:15.040 --> 01:23.190
RPA developer - or maybe both? I would like to congratulate you for making the first and most important

14
01:23.190 --> 01:25.810
step towards the future of work.

15
01:26.010 --> 01:28.190
So CONGRATULATIONS!

16
01:28.200 --> 01:32.740
I really wish you all the best in your life and your career, and I really hope you have enjoyed this course.

17
01:32.740 --> 01:33.920
...

18
01:33.930 --> 01:36.150
I'm looking forward to receiving your feedback.

19
01:36.150 --> 01:41.640
It means a lot to me to receive your thoughts and it will also help other students find the course and

20
01:41.670 --> 01:43.370
it will help me improve the content

21
01:43.410 --> 01:45.600
for new students.

22
01:45.600 --> 01:49.570
So have a wonderful day and see you around!
