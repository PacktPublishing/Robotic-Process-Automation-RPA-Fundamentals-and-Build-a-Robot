Further learning.

1
00:04.260 --> 00:09.540
With the knowledge you've gained in this training, I have some suggestions for what you can do next to further

2
00:09.540 --> 00:11.400
improve your RPA skills.

3
00:12.530 --> 00:19.610
UiPath offers their own online and free-of-charge(!) Academy, with more than 50 RPA courses, role-

4
00:19.610 --> 00:27.480
based learning plans and comprehensive product trainings. To access the courses, please navigate to

5
00:27.500 --> 00:29.750
academy.uipath.com

6
00:34.300 --> 00:40.210
Once you're here, you can go to the login or sign up button and you can sign in with the email and

7
00:40.210 --> 00:46.270
password that you use to sign up for UiPath Automation Cloud for Community when installing UiPath

8
00:46.270 --> 00:47.410
Studio earlier.

9
00:53.800 --> 01:00.280
Once you're in, you can navigate to "Courses" and you will see all available courses and you have the

10
01:00.280 --> 01:06.000
option to sort by, for example, course language, category, product and difficulty level.

11
01:07.510 --> 01:15.370
My recommendation is to go for the role-based learning plans, so simply navigate to "Learning By Role"

12
01:15.580 --> 01:22.150
and you will be presented the various learning plans. If you're an aspiring RPA Developer,

13
01:22.300 --> 01:28.870
I recommend starting out with the "RPA Developer Foundation" Learning Plan; before enrolling in the "RPA

14
01:28.870 --> 01:30.790
Developer Advanced" Learning Plan.

15
01:31.150 --> 01:36.400
The learning plans are covering theoretical concepts as well as hands-on exercises and quizzes, and

16
01:36.400 --> 01:41.550
will enable you to further increase your understanding of UiPath features and technology.

17
01:41.980 --> 01:47.650
It will also give a good indication of what becoming a professional RPA Developer will demand from

18
01:47.650 --> 01:50.000
your side in terms of the necessary hours

19
01:50.020 --> 01:58.060
you need to invest. If you are an aspiring RPA Project Manager, I recommend the "RPA Implementation

20
01:58.060 --> 02:00.190
Manager Foundation" plan.

21
02:01.150 --> 02:07.030
The Learning Plan covers the implementation methodology design by UiPath based on hands-on experience

22
02:07.030 --> 02:09.420
and feedback collected from key customers.

23
02:09.460 --> 02:15.070
The learning goals are to identify the different steps of an implementation, the ability to choose the

24
02:15.070 --> 02:20.770
processes suitable for automation, ability to drive an RPA project and raise RPA awareness

25
02:20.770 --> 02:22.330
throughout the organization.

26
02:22.420 --> 02:26.320
So pretty much what we covered already in our five step implementation plan,

27
02:26.320 --> 02:32.680
but in more detail. This training is also relevant if you choose other RPA software than UiPath

28
02:32.680 --> 02:33.630
for your company.

29
02:35.680 --> 02:41.470
To further help you out, here are some awesome resources that you may have a look at and bookmark in

30
02:41.470 --> 02:42.160
your browser.

31
02:42.430 --> 02:47.620
So first of all, we have the UiPath RPA Academy, and you already know what that is.

32
02:48.340 --> 02:54.580
Then we have the UiPath Community Forum to find information, post questions, discuss and learn from

33
02:54.580 --> 02:56.970
other RPA professionals all over the world.

34
02:57.760 --> 03:04.360
We have the UiPath Studio Guide, where you will find comprehensive information about UiPath Studio

35
03:04.780 --> 03:10.900
and we have the UiPath Activities Guide, where you will find comprehensive information about the various

36
03:10.900 --> 03:17.380
activities in UiPath studio; what they do, what their inputs are, what their outputs are, commons

37
03:17.380 --> 03:18.730
and so on.

38
03:20.050 --> 03:26.920
And for RPA developers in general, I can really recommend the Microsoft .NET documentation at

39
03:27.190 --> 03:27.730
...

40
03:27.760 --> 03:34.810
docs.microsoft.com. The .NET guide provides a large amount of information about the .NET framework.
