RPA - Pros (or benefits). Except from the fact that RPA have capabilities to mimic human interactions

1
00:12.180 --> 00:18.180
in the user interface layer of the computer and can work across most systems, applications and platforms;

2
00:18.690 --> 00:24.390
other benefits of the technology are: 24/7 operations.

3
00:25.410 --> 00:31.950
RPA is operational outside working hours and maintains efficiency 24/7.

4
00:32.610 --> 00:37.940
The robot never sleeps, never eats, never smokes and is never sick.

5
00:38.400 --> 00:40.830
Neither does it have sick children it needs to stay home with,

6
00:41.160 --> 00:49.200
so there will be no queues at peak. Cost reductions: Although there are some investments to be made

7
00:49.200 --> 00:51.870
to have a fully operational robotic enterprise,

8
00:52.140 --> 00:58.230
A robot costs approximately 1/10th of a human employee. Per automated process,

9
00:58.230 --> 01:05.160
we typically see a cost reduction of 30 to 60%. Improved efficiency:

10
01:05.640 --> 01:13.470
The robot is very fast and we typically see the robot do task 3 to 15x faster than human employees

11
01:13.470 --> 01:16.800
doing the same task. Quality:

12
01:17.670 --> 01:23.760
The robot is 100% accurate and therefore prevents errors typically made by humans.

13
01:24.090 --> 01:30.570
It is also increasing the focus on exceptions as these will be highlighted and left for humans to correct.

14
01:31.890 --> 01:33.240
Valuable work:

15
01:34.020 --> 01:42.180
Employees do not need to waste any capacity for routine tasks and can focus on more rewarding and value-

16
01:42.180 --> 01:44.400
adding activities in their enterprise.

17
01:45.750 --> 01:53.100
Short payback period: RPA implementation costs are usually paid off in less than 12 months.

18
01:54.210 --> 02:00.540
Scalability: capacity can be increased on-demand without a long or costly build-up face.

19
02:01.890 --> 02:03.540
Then we have Internal control:

20
02:04.140 --> 02:10.950
Every action taken by the robot is logged, which offers full audit logs so that we easily can perform

21
02:10.950 --> 02:14.550
control and compliance checks on the automated processes.

22
02:16.450 --> 02:22.600
And due to its ease of use, RPA software is often developed and configured by the business side in

23
02:22.600 --> 02:25.720
organizations, and only monitored by IT.

24
02:26.290 --> 02:30.070
This makes it more interesting than a lot of other technologies.

25
02:30.670 --> 02:33.820
It's also extremely fast to implement. Development,

26
02:33.820 --> 02:38.590
testing and implementation of a business process can be done within weeks.

27
02:40.600 --> 02:44.690
So these are the main benefits of the RPA technology.

28
02:44.920 --> 02:53.080
Let's have a look at a small example to see the benefits of applying RPA to a simple - but relevant -

29
02:53.080 --> 02:53.750
process.

30
02:55.780 --> 02:59.650
Most companies receive invoices from their suppliers.

31
02:59.650 --> 03:06.580
And suppose that we now have a company where all their invoices are stored in a centralized application.

32
03:07.660 --> 03:14.230
A simple process for a worker at our company would be to log into the invoice application once every

33
03:14.230 --> 03:20.050
day, manually search for today's invoices, control them; for example:

34
03:20.290 --> 03:22.150
Are the invoices approved?

35
03:22.510 --> 03:24.640
Does the financial accounts seem right?

36
03:25.000 --> 03:26.380
Is the invoice due?

37
03:26.740 --> 03:29.350
Is the invoice balanced? And so on...

38
03:30.070 --> 03:37.600
Then the employee would post the invoice and end the process. This is a task an RPA would handle

39
03:37.600 --> 03:42.190
with ease. The steps would look approximately the same,

40
03:42.700 --> 03:49.930
but if, for example, one of the invoices did not make it through the control in step number three,

41
03:50.500 --> 03:55.630
then the RPA would send the invoice to a human for manual control before it's posted.

42
03:57.560 --> 04:06.410
OK, so imagine that before RPA, the human employees spend two minutes controlling and posting every

43
04:06.410 --> 04:11.900
single invoice manually; and that the number of invoices per day was 1100.

44
04:12.650 --> 04:19.310
This means that it would take humans approximately 36,5 hours a day to control all

45
04:19.310 --> 04:20.060
invoices.

46
04:20.360 --> 04:24.410
And also humans should be expected to make a few mistakes along the way.

47
04:25.640 --> 04:31.040
Now, imagine that we have an RPA that could do the task in 20 seconds.

48
04:31.670 --> 04:37.700
The time spent on 1100 invoices a day would then be 367 minutes

49
04:37.700 --> 04:39.360
or 6 hours.

50
04:39.920 --> 04:46.820
That is 6x faster and only a few hours of human time would be needed to handle invoices with

51
04:46.820 --> 04:47.420
errors.

52
04:48.470 --> 04:54.650
So now I want you to pause a minute and just note down what benefits you see of automating this process.

53
04:55.100 --> 05:00.950
And you could also, for example, calculate the time saving of having robots doing this task instead

54
05:00.950 --> 05:01.850
of humans.

55
05:02.480 --> 05:07.490
You could, for instance, say that the robot could handle 90% of the invoices,

56
05:07.490 --> 05:12.770
so 10% are still sent to humans for extra control.
