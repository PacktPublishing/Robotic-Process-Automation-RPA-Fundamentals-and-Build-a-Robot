RPA - What it is and how it works.

1
00:07.870 --> 00:15.610
There are many different definitions of robotic process automation out there, but most include the

2
00:15.610 --> 00:21.420
words "software", "manual activity" and "repetitive tasks".

3
00:22.060 --> 00:22.930
And that is it:

4
00:22.990 --> 00:30.550
RPA is simply computer coded software that automates manual activities by performing repetitive

5
00:30.730 --> 00:32.390
rule-based tasks.

6
00:32.650 --> 00:37.560
And if that sounds confusing to you right now; don't worry - we'll soon see a demo.

7
00:38.170 --> 00:45.340
The RPA software can easily be programmed to do basic tasks across applications just us human workers do.

8
00:45.340 --> 00:52.240
The software can be taught - using recorders and easy programming language -, a workflow or process with

9
00:52.240 --> 00:59.120
multiple steps and applications and reduce the burden of repetitive simple tasks on employees.

10
00:59.140 --> 01:06.940
The higher volume and more mundane a task is, the better it's suited for robotic process automation. And just like industrial robots 

11
01:06.940 --> 01:09.230
transformed the factory floor,

12
01:09.340 --> 01:14.840
RPA bots are transforming, and will continue to transform, office tasks.

13
01:16.790 --> 01:18.030
How does it work?

14
01:18.620 --> 01:26.800
Well, RPA replicates human interactions on a computer using proven underlying technology like image recognition,

15
01:26.870 --> 01:33.260
text recognition, screen positioning, XML fragments and attributes and so on;

16
01:33.560 --> 01:41.140
and this technology is interacting with various windows buttons, folders, drop down-lists and so on,

17
01:41.300 --> 01:48.950
in the graphical user interface (GUI) of a computer. The graphical user interface of the computer is the

18
01:48.950 --> 01:53.180
user interface layer that we humans also mostly use,

19
01:53.330 --> 02:00.350
and this is one of the advantages of RPA, as it means the robot is able to automate work without compromising

20
02:00.350 --> 02:02.850
the underlying IT infrastructure.

21
02:03.290 --> 02:10.700
The robot can handle tasks like button clicks, cut/paste text, merging documents, do calculations, send

22
02:10.700 --> 02:13.310
emails, etc. like humans.

23
02:13.520 --> 02:21.890
It also reads applications such as Microsoft Word, Excel or Outlook; Notepad, customer relationship

24
02:21.890 --> 02:29.510
management systems (CRMs) such as Sales Force, enterprise resource management systems (ERPs) such as SAP and so on,

25
02:29.510 --> 02:33.640
which makes it a very powerful tool.

26
02:33.950 --> 02:39.000
The robot can be implemented at the desktop or in a virtual environment.

27
02:39.800 --> 02:46.040
So now that you have a firm understanding of what RPA is and how it works, let us have a look at

28
02:46.040 --> 02:48.510
a demo; that will clear things up.

29
02:50.480 --> 02:57.310
What you will see is an actual robot process automation and a robot performing a process on a desktop.

30
02:57.850 --> 03:06.890
The process consists of 1) Pulling a PDF attachment from an e-mail inbox. 2) Transforming the data from

31
03:06.890 --> 03:12.160
PDF to a row in a master Excel document that is saved on the machine.

32
03:12.350 --> 03:19.550
3) The robot logs into a web system and enters the data from the Excel sheet in the web system to generate

33
03:19.550 --> 03:28.530
an invoice, and 4) finally designated users are notified that the process is complete by email.

34
03:28.890 --> 03:36.200
The demo you will see is made by Deloitte, and the RPA software used in this demo as Automation Anywhere.

35
03:36.770 --> 03:41.960
You might want to see the video twice, as the robot is working very fast. Pay especially attention to

36
03:41.960 --> 03:47.690
the fact that the robot works in the graphical user interface layer and that it works perfectly fine

37
03:47.900 --> 03:51.470
in multiple applications and across those applications.

38
06:46.360 --> 06:52.970
In an RPA solution, robots are capable of mimicking most user actions in the graphical user interface layer,

39
06:52.970 --> 07:00.470
stretching from very manual and simple activities to more judgment-based and complex activities.

40
07:01.520 --> 07:02.640
From the demo,

41
07:02.750 --> 07:10.730
you already saw some of the capabilities of RPA like opening mail and extracting attachments, logging

42
07:10.730 --> 07:19.850
into and navigating applications, copying and pasting data, filling in forms and extracting structured

43
07:19.850 --> 07:22.150
data from documents.

44
07:22.730 --> 07:29.490
Other capabilities of RPA solutions are creating, moving and deleting files and folders;

45
07:29.750 --> 07:33.420
reading and writing to different databases,

46
07:33.530 --> 07:41.870
following simple decisions and rules, collecting statistics - for example from social media -, and connecting

47
07:41.870 --> 07:50.500
to APIs. Robots are also capable of making calculations and scraping data from the web.

48
07:54.350 --> 08:02.170
Most RPA solutions are also capable of working in several systems, applications and platforms.

49
08:02.360 --> 08:09.140
In the demo, you saw the robot work in desktop applications like Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Outlook,

50
08:09.710 --> 08:15.340
and you saw the robot work in a web application that was available through a browser.

51
08:16.710 --> 08:25.380
RPA solutions are usually capable of working in most enterprise resource planning systems, like SAP or

52
08:25.410 --> 08:27.070
Microsoft Dynamics Navision,

53
08:27.070 --> 08:35.910
- to mention a couple. They can be integrated with most databases, work with text-based file

54
08:35.910 --> 08:44.490
formats - like CSV, JSON or XML files -, work with mainframe green screens,

55
08:44.490 --> 08:53.470
obviously work with Microsoft Word, and work with remote desktop terminals like Citrix.

56
08:53.700 --> 09:01.350
The ability to work across different systems, applications and platforms is one of the main advantages

57
09:01.440 --> 09:04.440
of the RPA technology.

58
09:04.560 --> 09:09.010
We will address the pros and cons of RPA technology in a later lesson.
