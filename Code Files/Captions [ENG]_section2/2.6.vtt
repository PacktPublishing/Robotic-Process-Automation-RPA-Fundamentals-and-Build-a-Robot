RPA - Vendors.

1
00:05.870 --> 00:12.620
Firstly, I would like to just mention that I am in no way affiliated with or endorsed by any RPA

2
00:12.620 --> 00:13.350
providers.

3
00:14.180 --> 00:20.600
This lesson is based upon the work of Forrester, which is a well-known research and advisory firm

4
00:20.600 --> 00:26.900
worldwide, who performs quarterly and yearly evaluations of robotic process automation providers.

5
00:28.000 --> 00:34.180
Note that this is also an assessment of what Forrester find as the top vendors in the market, and it

6
00:34.180 --> 00:38.080
doesn't necessarily represent the entire vendor landscape.

7
00:39.810 --> 00:47.220
Forrester categorizes providers into what they call "Leaders", "Strong performers", "Contenders" and

8
00:47.220 --> 00:48.090
"Challengers".

9
00:48.930 --> 00:56.160
In its latest report, Forrester identified the 14 most significant RPA providers and researched, analyzed

10
00:56.160 --> 00:59.280
and scored them among 25 different criteria.

11
01:00.450 --> 01:06.600
The report shows how each provider measures up, and it helps organizations make the right choice when

12
01:06.600 --> 01:09.270
it comes to what RPA tool to use.

13
01:11.550 --> 01:19.140
The 25 evaluation criteria are grouped into three high level categories, the first one is "Current offering".

14
01:19.140 --> 01:19.740
...

15
01:20.460 --> 01:26.850
So each vendor's position on the vertical axis of the Forrester Wave graphic that you now see in front of

16
01:26.850 --> 01:30.480
you, indicates the strength of its current offering.

17
01:31.510 --> 01:38.740
Key criteria include task and process discovery and portfolio analysis, bot design and development,

18
01:39.070 --> 01:46.120
deployment and management of the bots; security and governance, scaling experience and architecture.

19
01:47.810 --> 01:53.720
And then we have "Strategy". Placement on the horizontal axis indicates the strength of the vendor's strategies,

20
01:53.720 --> 02:00.620
where product vision and innovation roadmap; delivery and support models, financial performance,

21
02:00.620 --> 02:03.260
and partner ecosystems are evaluated.

22
02:04.790 --> 02:11.960
The last high level category is "Market Presence", and market presence is represented by the size of

23
02:11.960 --> 02:19.580
the markers on the graphic. The score reflect each vendor's number and dollar value of RPA customers,

24
02:19.790 --> 02:22.800
as well as the overall RPA product revenue.

25
02:23.390 --> 02:31.510
There are six RPA providers that did very well among most criteria and that are evaluated as "Leaders".

26
02:32.030 --> 02:42.500
These are UiPath, Automation Anywhere, Microsoft, Nice, Kryon and Work Fusion; where UiPath was recognized

27
02:42.530 --> 02:49.070
as the ultimate leader and achieved the highest score in all of the three high level categories mentioned.

28
02:50.390 --> 02:55.850
Although UiPath has been pointed out as the leader for many years now, this is the first time they

29
02:55.850 --> 02:59.540
actually achieved the highest score in all these categories.

30
03:01.670 --> 03:07.400
Please also note that it may be of interest to pay attention to larger actors now entering the RPA

31
03:07.430 --> 03:08.190
market space.

32
03:08.840 --> 03:14.060
Microsoft is a newcomer on this list after acquiring Softomotive in 2020,

33
03:14.300 --> 03:20.000
and Microsoft are now offering RPA capabilities in their Power Automate product.

34
03:22.040 --> 03:28.520
Personally, I've been working with UiPath, Blue Prism and Automation Anywhere, and these are still

35
03:28.520 --> 03:34.430
the three RPA providers with the highest presence and size in the market space, meaning that they

36
03:34.430 --> 03:37.130
are the market leaders speaking in more traditional terms.

37
03:40.220 --> 03:46.190
Looking at another ranking of RPA providers, and this time from IT Central Station, which is one

38
03:46.190 --> 03:52.160
of the world's leading product reviews sites for enterprise technology, we again find UiPath as the

39
03:52.160 --> 03:55.230
leader, followed by Automation Anywhere and Blue Prism.

40
03:56.150 --> 04:03.440
So this is a very interesting ranking as it's based solely on aggregated user reviews. To find out how

41
04:03.440 --> 04:07.230
they compare on a more detailed level and to find the right tool for you,

42
04:07.280 --> 04:13.520
I suggest you have a deeper look at the Forrester Wave report or at the user reviews at IT Central Station,

43
04:13.790 --> 04:17.690
and I will provide you with the links.

44
04:17.810 --> 04:19.010
In this training, we will continue with UiPath.

45
04:19.010 --> 04:26.090
UiPath offers the proven and reliable tools and technologies needed to build effective RPA bots

46
04:26.090 --> 04:29.180
for even the most complex of processes.

47
04:29.540 --> 04:35.420
And I believe UiPath will continue to lead the way in developing new and innovative technology that

48
04:35.420 --> 04:39.980
helps drive RPA adoption in more businesses and organizations around the globe.

49
04:40.940 --> 04:43.280
UiPath is the most popular tool,

50
04:43.280 --> 04:46.420
it has free online training and certification programs,

51
04:46.700 --> 04:53.390
it has a great and open community for both developers and project managers that you can participate

52
04:53.390 --> 04:54.410
and contribute in.

53
04:54.830 --> 04:59.540
And it is also the tool, of course, where I have the most hands-on experience myself.

54
05:00.890 --> 05:06.560
In the next module, you will download and use their software for free and immediately start learning

55
05:06.560 --> 05:07.570
RPA development.

56
05:07.580 --> 05:09.980
So that is really something to look forward to.
