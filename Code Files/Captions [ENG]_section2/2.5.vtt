RPA - Cons (or disadvantages)

1
00:07.940 --> 00:17.420
First of all, not all tasks are ideal for RPA. The automation capabilities provided by RPA are

2
00:17.450 --> 00:25.700
ideal for tasks that are repetitive, rules based, high volume, and that do not require human judgment.

3
00:26.480 --> 00:33.500
RPA implementation is especially difficult with business processes that are non-standardized and require

4
00:33.500 --> 00:36.370
frequent human intervention in order to execute.

5
00:37.340 --> 00:43.700
Also, processes that do not have digital standardized inputs are not suitable to be automated with

6
00:43.700 --> 00:45.300
today's RPA solutions.

7
00:45.980 --> 00:52.280
An example would be when a customer sends their bank a letter, that is paper-based and unstructured.

8
00:52.880 --> 00:58.910
The company would then receive, scan and reallocate this letter to the correct department for processing.

9
00:59.480 --> 01:06.390
In this case, RPA will only work with a collection of other implemented technologies  such as OCR -

10
01:06.740 --> 01:09.590
required to make it digital and structured.

11
01:10.340 --> 01:13.880
This can become a costly hurdle before RPA can be applied,

12
01:14.600 --> 01:20.990
so it's very important for companies to determine which of their processes are suitable for RPA so that

13
01:20.990 --> 01:22.490
automation runs smoothly.

14
01:23.990 --> 01:27.740
Non-optimal processes should not be automated.

15
01:28.760 --> 01:30.740
Don't automate bad processes.

16
01:31.100 --> 01:37.640
Processes need to be streamlined and mapped out to ensure automation can deliver the anticipated benefits.

17
01:38.300 --> 01:44.570
Processes that are unstable or prone to change are not good candidates for RPA.

18
01:47.290 --> 01:55.180
Any process change means updating of the RPA code. Bear in mind that changes like modified data field

19
01:55.180 --> 02:02.440
mappings, change in email addresses, vendor upgrades to systems and applications can affect the robot

20
02:02.440 --> 02:06.010
functionality and might need code maintenance.

21
02:08.060 --> 02:14.780
There is still need for human intervention as robots don't respond well to exceptions. Humans will

22
02:14.780 --> 02:20.120
still have to manage exceptions and deal with any scenarios that robots cannot handle.

23
02:21.830 --> 02:23.810
And although I said that

24
02:24.890 --> 02:29.910
robots are usually built and configured by the business side in the organization;

25
02:30.170 --> 02:37.100
there is still need for IT involvement. Though RPA is marketed as a tool for business users to achieve

26
02:37.100 --> 02:44.600
quick improvements, IT involvement is essential to ensure that support, disaster recovery and change

27
02:44.600 --> 02:46.250
management procedures are followed.

28
02:46.820 --> 02:53.690
This is particularly important because broader architecture and system changes can affect the operation

29
02:53.690 --> 02:54.560
of robots.

30
02:56.870 --> 03:01.070
Then there is the fact that RPA is not especially intelligent today.

31
03:01.700 --> 03:04.150
It's not a cognitive computing solution.

32
03:04.160 --> 03:12.170
It cannot learn from experience - yet. As a process evolve, for example through the introduction and

33
03:12.170 --> 03:17.800
use of other technologies; robots may become redundant and require changes.

34
03:17.810 --> 03:24.740
Here I would just like to add a side note that there are a lot of initiatives going on at most of the RPA

35
03:24.740 --> 03:31.550
software vendors on including more cognitive technologies, like machine learning, in the software.

36
03:32.150 --> 03:36.320
So this is a field where RPA is evolving very quickly.

37
03:38.460 --> 03:47.580
OK, so another disadvantage of RPA is employee resistance and onboarding. Any changes to a

38
03:47.580 --> 03:53.490
company implementation of a new technology can be stressful for employees as they might experience

39
03:53.490 --> 03:59.570
shifts in their own responsibilities - or worse, they might lose their jobs to the machines.

40
04:00.360 --> 04:06.930
Frequent communication from company leaders and executive sponsors to ensure employees are fully informed

41
04:06.930 --> 04:13.740
about what is expected of them throughout the implementation process is essential to successful adoption

42
04:13.740 --> 04:14.700
of RPA.

43
04:15.480 --> 04:21.210
Fostering a culture of innovation within the company will only further accelerate this adoption.

44
04:23.200 --> 04:29.860
There is a need to manage the RPA solution and Team; meaning that you need both people and competence

45
04:29.860 --> 04:30.940
to be successful.

46
04:31.570 --> 04:38.470
Although robots alone are not very expensive, having a Center of Excellence (CoE) and allocating resources

47
04:38.470 --> 04:45.580
to manage the RPA solution is extremely important, and there are some initial investments needed to

48
04:45.820 --> 04:47.560
be made to make this happen.

49
04:49.450 --> 04:54.280
In a later lesson, we'll talk more about how to create an RPA Center of Excellence and what roles

50
04:54.280 --> 04:57.120
and responsibilities that are needed.
