00:02.140 --> 00:10.240
RPA - Why now? Now that we have a little more understanding of what RPA is and what it is capable of,

1
00:10.240 --> 00:15.390
let us take a step back and look at why you should learn RPA right now!

2
00:17.520 --> 00:20.800
A wave of automation anxiety has hit us.

3
00:21.180 --> 00:28.500
Just try typing "Will robots" into Google, and an algorithm offers to complete the sentence with differing

4
00:28.500 --> 00:30.240
degrees of disquiet.

5
00:30.960 --> 00:33.570
"Will robots take over the world?"

6
00:34.320 --> 00:36.630
"Will robots replace humans?"

7
00:37.260 --> 00:39.360
"Will robots rule the world?"

8
00:40.140 --> 00:43.230
Or will robots simply "take my job"?

9
00:44.970 --> 00:47.760
Well, they might do.

10
00:47.760 --> 00:50.330
Job-grabbing robots are no longer science fiction.

11
00:50.340 --> 00:56.700
And as one of many examples, JPMorgan built a software for interpreting commercial loan agreements

12
00:56.700 --> 01:03.060
that consumed 360.000 hours of work each year, previously performed by lawyers

13
01:03.060 --> 01:04.440
and loan officers.

14
01:05.310 --> 01:12.420
The software reviews documents in seconds, is less error prone, and it never asks for a break as opposed

15
01:12.420 --> 01:14.160
to its human colleagues.

16
01:15.730 --> 01:22.780
Recently, MIT Technology Review summarized the findings from several published reports by a range of

17
01:22.780 --> 01:29.290
companies, research institutions and experts and presented them in a chart. Looking at it, I would

18
01:29.290 --> 01:32.650
say that the main finding is that no one agrees.

19
01:33.100 --> 01:40.120
Predictions range from optimistic to devastating, differing by tens of millions of jobs, even when

20
01:40.120 --> 01:46.900
comparing similar time frames. Although these predictions are made by dozens of global experts in economics

21
01:46.900 --> 01:47.770
and technology,

22
01:47.980 --> 01:50.460
no one seems to be on the same page.

23
01:51.400 --> 01:57.070
One conclusion from this could be that we have no idea how many jobs will actually be lost to the march

24
01:57.070 --> 02:02.130
of technological progress, while another could be that change is coming.

25
02:02.890 --> 02:05.220
All reports and experts agree on this front.

26
02:05.560 --> 02:09.900
It's only time frames and the scale of impact of automation, on unemployment

27
02:09.910 --> 02:11.440
that's up for debate.

28
02:13.330 --> 02:18.310
Please also note that when I refer to robots and automation, we are talking about both industrial robots

29
02:18.310 --> 02:25.240
and software robots. An "industrial robot" is a robot system used for manufacturing and are usually

30
02:25.240 --> 02:26.530
seen in factories.

31
02:26.950 --> 02:34.090
Typical applications include painting, assembly, welding, packaging and labelling, palletizing,

32
02:34.090 --> 02:35.650
product inspection and testing.

33
02:36.280 --> 02:43.210
While "software robots" are not physical and can loosely be defined as any type of software that incorporates

34
02:43.210 --> 02:46.720
AI and or automates formerly manual processes.

35
02:47.170 --> 02:53.500
Examples are expert systems, machine learning algorithms, virtual voice assistants, chatbots

36
02:53.500 --> 02:56.180
and our very own RPA technology.

37
02:57.070 --> 03:03.610
Anyway, the point being - learning about software robots will position you better for the future of work.

38
03:04.800 --> 03:10.200
Machines replacing humans in the workplace has been a perpetual concern since the industrial revolution

39
03:10.200 --> 03:14.520
and an increasing topic of discussion with the rise of automation.

40
03:15.270 --> 03:21.210
Although new technologies eliminate some occupations; in many areas, they improve the quality of work

41
03:21.210 --> 03:27.960
that humans do by allowing them to focus on more strategic, value creating and personally rewarding tasks.

42
03:29.010 --> 03:34.770
I personally believe that instead of automation taking our jobs, the face of automation may look more

43
03:34.770 --> 03:38.160
like the restructuring of jobs rather than the replacement.

44
03:38.760 --> 03:44.430
However, no one will know for sure exactly how automation will affect jobs, skills and wages.

45
03:44.760 --> 03:49.410
And to use a reference from Game of Thrones, "Winter is Coming".

46
03:49.680 --> 03:50.940
Whether we want it or not;

47
03:50.970 --> 03:53.040
It is better to be safe than to be sorry.

48
03:53.050 --> 03:55.920
So be prepared for an automated future.

49
03:58.070 --> 04:01.490
Then what are the challenges that today's organizations face?

50
04:01.970 --> 04:06.860
Well, overall, we can see heightened expectations from different stakeholders.

51
04:07.760 --> 04:12.590
Business owners expect improved efficiency and utilization of resources.

52
04:12.740 --> 04:14.540
As always, I would say.

53
04:15.430 --> 04:21.700
So how can we cut costs, increase income and profits and still provide the same or even greater value

54
04:21.700 --> 04:23.230
to our customers?

55
04:24.780 --> 04:31.470
Customers on their side demand 24/7 service availability, immediate response times and a high degree

56
04:31.470 --> 04:35.100
of personalization. How can we satisfy these needs?

57
04:36.000 --> 04:43.260
Governmental agencies require greater levels of transparency, traceability and compliance. And employees

58
04:43.320 --> 04:48.630
want tasks that are intellectually stimulating, more challenging, more strategic, more value creating

59
04:48.630 --> 04:50.580
and personally rewarding.

60
04:51.480 --> 04:55.840
How do we meet the heightened expectations from all these stakeholders?

61
04:56.430 --> 05:00.490
The solution is a future where humans and machines work hand in hand.

62
05:00.510 --> 05:04.290
So please welcome "The Digital Workforce".

63
05:06.440 --> 05:13.040
"The Digital Workforce" consists of a wide range of technologies that is integrated with each other and

64
05:13.040 --> 05:20.150
with the human workforce to deliver value across the enterprise. To better understand how these technologies

65
05:20.150 --> 05:28.190
can benefit the organization, it helps to "humanize" digital employees and categorize them by skill set.

66
05:28.970 --> 05:33.680
I've come up with four different categories that I want to share with you.

67
05:34.910 --> 05:37.880
The first is "The Communicator".

68
05:38.510 --> 05:46.100
"The Communicator" is the social one and communicates with humans by text-to-speech, speech-to-text or

69
05:46.160 --> 05:47.690
speech-to-speech dialogue.

70
05:48.350 --> 05:56.250
"The Communicator" is represented by technology like chatbots and digital voice assistants such as Google's

71
05:56.270 --> 06:01.230
Assistant, Microsoft's Cortana, Apple's Siri or Amazon's Alexa.

72
06:02.390 --> 06:04.400
Then we have "The Supporter".

73
06:05.360 --> 06:10.520
"The Supporter" is extremely good at analyzing big data and visually express it.

74
06:11.000 --> 06:17.090
"The Supporter" is represented by artificial intelligence and more traditional mathematical predictive analysis.

75
06:17.090 --> 06:17.960
...

76
06:18.950 --> 06:25.460
Then we have "The Digital Reader" who will be responsible for capturing and uploading data for use across

77
06:25.460 --> 06:26.310
the enterprise.

78
06:26.780 --> 06:33.290
Today, for example, a warehouse employee must write down and manually enter new shipments of parts

79
06:33.290 --> 06:34.610
and equipment that arrive.

80
06:35.240 --> 06:41.750
"The Digital Reader" will capture images of packaging slips and automagically update the inventory.

81
06:42.320 --> 06:48.710
"The Digital Reader" is represented through cognitive automation technologies, smart OCR and machine learning.

82
06:49.490 --> 06:53.780
And finally, we have what I like to call "The Worker".

83
06:54.980 --> 06:56.680
That's the one that get things done.

84
06:57.080 --> 07:03.530
"The Worker" performs rule-based, repetitive tasks at a high pace and with high precision.

85
07:04.110 --> 07:11.980
This can be a tasks such as entering and processing data, comparing data sets, sending automatic emails,

86
07:12.110 --> 07:15.710
create reports, do reconciliations and more.

87
07:15.860 --> 07:17.540
And yes, you are right.

88
07:17.960 --> 07:23.150
"The Worker" is represented by robotic process automation technology.

89
07:25.370 --> 07:32.300
Now you hopefully understand from a high-level perspective why RPA is relevant. If we look more

90
07:32.300 --> 07:39.680
in detail at RPA, there are especially two reasons RPA is so relevant when it comes to automating

91
07:39.830 --> 07:41.330
modern office tasks.

92
07:41.870 --> 07:48.300
These are that 1) Employees today use a lot more different tools compared to the past.

93
07:48.800 --> 07:53.740
It is not feasible to automate all those tools and their interactions with simple macros.

94
07:55.010 --> 08:00.980
If you think about it, there is an app for everything today; hosted in the cloud, integrated via

95
08:00.980 --> 08:07.390
APIs. CRM, ERP, productivity app and other apps run today's enterprises.

96
08:08.000 --> 08:11.370
So why do we need to build our specialized robots then?

97
08:11.840 --> 08:13.970
Well, the problem is business processes.

98
08:14.390 --> 08:20.900
Business processes need input from different tools and we have been using an increasing number of tools

99
08:20.900 --> 08:21.570
every year.

100
08:22.040 --> 08:30.410
In 1990, Microsoft Office had three products: Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel and Microsoft PowerPoint.

101
08:31.430 --> 08:34.790
Today, Microsoft 365 has nine products:

102
08:35.060 --> 08:43.100
Microsoft Outlook, OneDrive, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, SharePoint, Teams and Yammer.

103
08:43.910 --> 08:47.300
With more tools comes the need for integration.

104
08:48.020 --> 08:55.460
Though every major tool has an API, the developer company may not provide open access to the API.

105
08:55.460 --> 09:02.270
Without API access, users are forced to export complex CSVs and resort to other complex but boring data

106
09:02.280 --> 09:03.170
janitor work.

107
09:03.740 --> 09:05.090
But who can blame the vendors?

108
09:05.480 --> 09:07.820
Every vendor wants to have a sticky product.

109
09:08.150 --> 09:15.470
Sadly, making integration and data migration difficult increases switching costs and creates frustrated,

110
09:15.470 --> 09:16.700
but loyal customers.

111
09:18.260 --> 09:20.760
Sometimes vendors aren't the only ones to blame.

112
09:20.780 --> 09:29.570
Most large companies still use some systems built with early 2000s technology - and I mean some companies

113
09:29.570 --> 09:29.930
with

114
09:29.930 --> 09:36.950
even 1990s technology. And legacy systems are not supposed to be providing integration to modern tools.

115
09:37.490 --> 09:40.640
RPA provides the solution to these problems,

116
09:40.640 --> 09:45.930
and software robots step up to bridge to gaps between systems.

117
09:46.490 --> 09:53.810
The other reason is that 2) Outsourcing no longer creates benefits, as most benefits of outsourcing have

118
09:53.840 --> 09:55.900
been reaped. In the past,

119
09:55.910 --> 10:01.790
the way most companies handle the overhead required to carry out simple, repetitive, high volume and

120
10:01.790 --> 10:04.540
manual tasks was simply to outsource them.

121
10:05.150 --> 10:08.810
They received the same results without remotely the same costs.

122
10:09.380 --> 10:11.330
Well, that was once a massive advantage.

123
10:11.330 --> 10:15.750
It's fading and outsourcing is simply not the same game changer it once was.

124
10:16.220 --> 10:23.900
My claim is still and always that learning RPA will make you ready for the future of work.

125
10:23.900 --> 10:25.760
With so much interest in a topic

126
10:25.760 --> 10:29.840
consulting companies have already put together their own RPA offerings.

127
10:30.410 --> 10:35.570
Learning RPA and understanding the impact of automation and the digital-human combination of your

128
10:35.570 --> 10:38.280
workplace will be very important.

129
10:38.960 --> 10:45.290
This is true whether you want to pursue a career as an RPA Project Manager or RPA Developer.

130
10:46.160 --> 10:52.880
Lastly, I would like to add that despite the economic pressures caused by the covid-19 pandemic, the

131
10:52.880 --> 10:59.060
RPA market still grew 20% in the first year of the crisis, according to Gartner, which is

132
10:59.060 --> 11:01.970
one of the world's leading research and advisory companies.

133
11:02.690 --> 11:09.320
This, again, shows that RPA technology is highly relevant and that it will deliver long term benefits

134
11:09.320 --> 11:10.240
in the years ahead.
