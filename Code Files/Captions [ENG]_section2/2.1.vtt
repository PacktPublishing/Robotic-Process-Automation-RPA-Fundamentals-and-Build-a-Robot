- What is RPA and how does it work? 

1
00:07.010 --> 00:15.560
Welcome to this very first section of this course, where we'll cover RPA - what it is and how it works,

2
00:15.890 --> 00:17.110
why now,

3
00:17.270 --> 00:23.780
the pros and cons of the technology, what vendors are out there, and where we'll do a little RPA case study

4
00:23.780 --> 00:26.980
At the end of this section,

5
00:27.050 --> 00:31.140
you'll be able to explain what Robotic Process Automation is,

6
00:31.160 --> 00:37.940
explain how it works, why it's such a hot topic right now and what the pros and cons of the technology are;

7
00:37.940 --> 00:45.210
so that you confidently can discuss RPA in an enterprise setting or at a job interview.

8
00:45.320 --> 00:50.570
And since this is the first section of the course, I'll also quickly mention what we'll cover in later sections

9
00:50.810 --> 00:52.010
- so that you know what's coming.

10
00:54.820 --> 00:58.300
When we finish the section on what RPA is and how it works,

11
00:58.300 --> 01:04.470
we'll continue with the section "Build your first robot", where we will cover the UiPath platform.

12
01:04.570 --> 01:06.940
how to install UiPath Studio,

13
01:06.940 --> 01:13.780
we will get to know the UiPath Studio user interface, and we'll of course build a simple robot.

14
01:14.000 --> 01:20.470
Then we'll have a section on how to pilot RPA in your enterprise.

15
01:20.470 --> 01:26.530
Here we'll have a look at a five step basic plan for piloting and implementing RPA.

16
01:26.590 --> 01:31.200
We will have a look at how we can create an RPA Center of Excellence,

17
01:31.240 --> 01:37.840
we will look at some critical success factors for an RPA initiative and we will have more examples of

18
01:37.840 --> 01:41.200
how RPA has been applied in the real world,

19
01:41.200 --> 01:47.890
Before we wrap-it all up with a short section on further learning and what you can do next to improve

20
01:47.890 --> 01:53.580
your RPA skills, whether you're an aspiring RPA developer or RPA project manager.

21
01:54.220 --> 01:57.580
But first - What is RPA and how does it work?
