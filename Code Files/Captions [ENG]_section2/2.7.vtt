RPA - Case Study. Let us have a look at a real world example of how RPA has been piloted in a

1
00:11.400 --> 00:16.630
Norwegian real estate company by the management consulting firm Knowit Insight.

2
00:17.130 --> 00:17.430
...

3
00:17.460 --> 00:25.260
So, the company - Malling & Co - is a Norwegian real estate agency and it is helping its clients achieve the full

4
00:25.260 --> 00:31.260
potential of their commercial properties, covering everything from ensuring smooth operation for tenants,

5
00:31.610 --> 00:36.510
to getting the most from a rental or a sales process.

6
00:36.660 --> 00:44.460
Malling & Co has about 40.000 invoices coming from suppliers every year, and every single invoice is manually

7
00:44.460 --> 00:47.200
controlled and booked in the financial system.

8
00:47.400 --> 00:52.950
The process for doing this is straightforward, and do you know of anyway this could be improved using

9
00:52.950 --> 00:55.860
new technology?

10
00:55.890 --> 01:04.050
You are right - RPA solved the problem, and a robot named "Alfred" was hired to do the task.

11
01:04.230 --> 01:07.120
Let's have a look at Alfred doing his thing.

12
02:36.440 --> 02:43.730
As a result, Alfred is now handling 50% of all incoming invoices by himself.

13
02:44.210 --> 02:51.140
It took the management consulting firm 6 weeks to implement the automated process, and the investment

14
02:51.140 --> 02:54.910
paid itself in approximately six months.

15
02:55.070 --> 03:00.790
On top of that, a lot of new RPA opportunities was identified during the project.

16
03:06.080 --> 03:13.280
[Section summary]. In this section of course, we have covered what RPA is and how it works, why it is interesting right now, 

17
03:13.310 --> 03:19.360
what benefits and disadvantages the technology has, what vendors there are,

18
03:19.430 --> 03:25.840
and we even had a look at a real world example of how RPA has been applied to generate value for a

19
03:25.850 --> 03:27.430
Norwegian real estate company.
